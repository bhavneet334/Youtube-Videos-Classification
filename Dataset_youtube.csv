I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel BloggingMy advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time BloggerSetting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:Pick your domain nameSign up for your hosting planInstall WordpressInstall your themeStart bloggingSetup your blog here for just $3.95:++ http://bit.ly/create-a-travel-blog-we...// How to Write a Travel BlogThe really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.I‚Äôve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling somethingPaid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white stripsAdsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my websiteFreelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businessesSelling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger// find your speciality- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you‚Äôd be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you‚Äôd be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you‚Äôre interested in and own it// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeedIf you need any help creating your website and starting your travel vlog, let me know in the comments, I reply to every single one.// FOLLOW US: IG: https://www.instagram.com/lifetailored/Wei's IG: https://www.instagram.com/threadtherapy/Couple's IG: https://www.instagram.com/meetthewises/Web: https://lifetailored.com/// Best Vlogging Kit for BeginnersBest Starter Vlogging Camera: Canon 60D: https://fave.co/2wpomKJBest Vlogging Lens: Canon 10-22mm 3.5: https://fave.co/2MDQ807High-End 4K Camera for Photo/Video: Canon 5D Mark IV: https://fave.co/2vaPUTvHigh-End Zoom Lens for Photo/Video/B-roll: Canon 24m-70mm 2.8 II: https://fave.co/2AyMHSDThe content in this video is accurate as of the posting date.

46,7V2pJOUe4E4,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Trerice, Cornwall","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. By the 16th century the Arundell family had become well-established and was connected by marriage to nearly all the other landed families in Cornwall.The status of the family increased through various members gaining good positions at the Royal court. Their legacy is this grand manor on a Cornish scale. The Arundells inherited Trerice through marriage around 700 years ago. By 1572 John Arundell V had begun building the house we know today. Ten years earlier his income had been boosted by marrying well. Son of the builder of Trerice, Sir John Arundell VI earned the title John for the King due to his role in the Civil War, especially his defence of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth for Charles I. After the restoration of Charles II, Richard Arundell became Baron Arundell in recognition of the support he and his father had given Charles I. We know little about how the Arundell family lived at Trerice. The Arundell line died out in 1768, and Trerice passed to the Aclands. It was the marriage of John, 2nd Baron Arundell to Margaret Acland in 1675 that eventually led to the great Devonian family based at Killerton inheriting Trerice. Sir Thomas Dyke Acland never lived at Trerice but often stayed on his political forays into Cornwall. He also used the Great Hall for entertaining. Initially arriving at Trerice as tenants of its last private owner, the Eltons took on the tenancy from the National Trust in 1953. At his own expense, John Elton paid for the repair of the remaining parts of Trerice - and went on to rebuild the fallen north wing. His aim was to create a comfortable family home.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

48,l1n3AtFYl10,The day I got attacked and robbed in Argentina (Travel Video Blog 042),This is so far the worst travel experience I've ever had: During my weekend trip to Cordoba I got attacked by 2 guys without any warning. I never got confronted with this kind of violence - I was brought to the hospital and spend around 5 hours there.It was at some point maybe also my fault as said in the video - but bad things can happen everywhere in the world. I was amazed by the great help I received afterwards from all the people around me - especially the argentine people have been so nice to me which actually makes me even love Argentina more!I thank all of you guys for your kind words and support afterwards - with your help I'm now almost recovered and continue what I love to do: Traveling.#HolaGringo is supported by:Hostelbookers: http://www.hostelbookers.comTraveldudes: http://www.traveldudes.orgFollow me:http://www.back-packer.orghttp://www.twitter.com/BackPackerStevehttp://www.facebook.com/BackPackerBlog,Travel Blogs
49,35reI2AqbrM,A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger,"Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like. 'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger, but it does mean there's no 'typical' day. In this day in my life video, I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle, but just like the job itself, every press trip is different. This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day, my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos, as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing. In this vlog, I used the Canon M50, Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: https://www.alajode.com/blogging-vlog...As always, thanks for watching! I hope you enjoy this insight into a day in the life of a travel blogger - even if there's no such thing as a 'normal' day in this career!#travelblogger",Travel Blogs

53,WMhkRzeGIMI,How to Be a Travel Blogger ‚Äî Creating Great Content,"This is the intro video for the course Being a Travel Blogger (Even When You're Not Traveling!). If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9You don‚Äôt have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9)Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you‚Äôre not traveling? It‚Äôs a unique form of writer‚Äôs block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it‚Äôs been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What‚Äôs a travel blogger to do?Well, I‚Äôm here to help you kick that writer‚Äôs block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",Travel Blogs

Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",Travel Blogs

So I thought I'd share some more substantial thoughts on how to have the right mindset, expectations, and process to be successful in travel blogging. 5 years ago I benefited a lot from what others taught about blogging so, in turn, hopefully you will find my random thoughts useful in some way!VERY SORRY for the focus moving in and out.

Tintagel castle is actually English Heritage, so I got my wires crossed and presumed it was NT because the OLD POST OFFICE is just down the road.  I think I may have gone to visit for free, oh well. It was not really very accessible but the guys did their best to get my scooter down the hill to the bottom, at ¬£2 each way. You would need to be able to board a land rover, otherwise, the visit will be impossible.The site of Tintagel Castle has been inhabited at least since the late Roman period, and a community flourished here in the 5th to 7th centuries. In the 12th century Tintagel gained literary fame when Geoffrey of Monmouth named it as the place where King Arthur was conceived. These Arthurian associations may have inspired Richard, Earl of Cornwall, to build a castle at Tintagel in the 1230s, and the enduring legend still ensures Tintagel‚Äôs international renown.Additional Music:Ocean by THBD https://soundcloud.com/thbdsultanCreative Commons ‚Äî Attribution 3.0 Unported‚Äî CC BY 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...Music provided by Audio Library https://youtu.be/VAz3HfbdKyQ-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

In this episode I visit NUFFIELD PLACE, the home of Lord and Lady Nuffield, otherwise known as William Morris of the car name fame. He purchased the home and garden and made it his, by extending and modifying it to suit his needs.Career wise he started as an apprentice bicycle repairer and moved into making them when his request for a pay rise was rejected.  Later, he went into making cars and built the name of Morris around the Cowley area of Oxfordshire.Morris purchased Wolsley in the expansion process and during his lifetime put the profits to good use, donating about ¬£8bn equivalent nowadays to charitable causes in the medical and education arena, such as Nuffield Orthopedic Hospital where I had my second back operation.While scooters were a problem, they made an effort and provided me with a pusher/wheelchair.

The National Trust displays the house as a comfortable home. On display in the house is a collection of 18th- to 20th-century costumes, originally known as the Paulise de Bush collection, shown in period rooms.The estate covers some 2590 hectares (25.9 km2, 6400 acres).Included in the Estate is a steep wooded hillside with the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort on top of it, also known as Dolbury which has also yielded evidence of Roman occupation, thought to be a possible fort or marching camp within the Hillfort.Killerton House itself and the Bear's Hut summerhouse in the grounds are Grade II* listed buildings.The gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/c/AndyWrightT...Qigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/c/TrainingThe...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

The garden has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1955 when it was donated by Ida Copeland following the death of her son Geoffrey. A stained glass memorial bearing the Copeland Crest remains to this effect in Feock parish church. The house and garden had formerly been owned and developed by the Daniell family, which had made its fortune in the 18th Century Cornish copper mining industry.Many of the species that flourish in the mild Cornish air, including the rhododendrons and azaleas which are now such a feature of the garden, were planted by the Copelands including hydrangeas, camellias and flowering cherries, and exotics such as the ginkgo and various species of palm. They also ensured that the blossoms they nurtured had a wider, if unknowing audience. Mr Ronald Copeland was chairman and later managing director of his family's business, the Spode china factory, and flowers grown at Trelissick were used as models for those painted on ware produced at the works.The Copeland family crest, a horse's head, now decorates the weathervane on the turret of the stable block, making a pair with the Gilbert squirrels on the Victorian Gothic water tower, an echo of the family who lived here in the second half of the 19th century (their ancestor, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, was lost at sea in his tiny ship Squirrel after discovering Newfoundland).The garden is noted for its rare shrubs. It offers a large park, woodland walks, views over the estuary of the River Fal and Falmouth.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

154,HMBQmTf-tsI,#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!),"#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!)It feels like everyone now a days is interested in being in a travel blogger. Around the New Year, people get so excited and set all these goals for themselves. They think of a clever blog name, buy their domain, set up their wordpress and all that jazz,. After a few month, the excitement starts to fizzle, you're not as enthusiastic anymore. You're not seeing traffic to your site, or engagement, and then start wondering if you made a big mistake. You may start writing less and less, and just give up on it all together.Let me ask you this. If you opened a restaurant or a brick and mortar shop, do you think you'd become profitable after a couple of months? You would have to have money saved up to pay ""rent"" because after all, it takes spending money to make money right? In this video, I‚Äôll talk about my #1 reason why most travel blogs fail (and no, it's not the lack of travel.)::::::Sidewalker Daily is committed to bridging the gap between travel brands and content creators by providing unparalleled support and educational resources on best industry practices.

Catch the cottage on a sunny Summers day and you won't find a prettier place in Dorset to spend a couple of hours.The cottage stands at the top of the hill off Cuckoo Lane in Higher Bockhampton and behind it stretches Egdon Heath, which Hardy wrote of in 'The Return of the Native'.

171,rMUZGDBdnTc,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Badbury Rings, location not in the manual","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. Badbury Rings is an Iron Age hill fort in east Dorset, England. It was in the territory of the Durotriges. In the Roman era, a temple was located immediately west of the fort, and there was a Romano-British town known as Vindocladia a short distance to the south-west.Badbury Rings is 327 feet (100 m) above sea level. There are two main phases of construction; the first covered 7.3 hectares (18 acres) and was defended by multiple ditches, while the second was more than twice the size, covering 16.6 ha (41 acres) and defended by a single ditch and rampart. Bronze Age round barrows in the vicinity demonstrate an earlier use of the area.Until 1983 Badbury Rings were privately owned as part of the Kingston Lacy estate, and the owners discouraged investigation of the site. The site now belongs to the National Trust. A survey of the hillfort by the RCHME was begun in 1993. The summit area was cleared of undergrowth by the National Trust in 1997 and the conifer plantation was thinned out. This allowed the RCHME to complete the survey in 1998, which recorded 28 potential hut sites within the ramparts,[3] although some depressions are probably caused by uprooted trees. The first excavations, led by Martin Papworth, took place in 2004, when three evaluation trenches were dug. Almost all of the pottery found was dated to the Late Iron Age. The current evidence does not suggest that the hillfort was a principal settlement in the Early Iron Age.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

178,ax1k3EJvv4c,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Clyston Mill, near Exeter","There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can, reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. The miller had an 'eye' for the flow of the water, an 'ear' for the sound of stones grounding, a 'thumb' for the quality of flour and a 'feel' for the slow working of the mill.There has been a mill named Clyston at Broadclyst for many hundreds of years. The first mention of it was first made in The Domesday Book in 1086, where it was referred to as Clistone/tona mill. Its location was a mystery at this time, but it was thought to be on a stretch of a river north of where the mill is today.In 1806, Samuel Flood had the mill and a windmill ion the other side of the village. Proof of it in this location was given in 1859 when tenant miller Richard Burton was unable to mill flour on many occasions due to the lack of water, so he bought a steam engine from London to power the mill. In 1862, a disastrous fire started in the mill stable and ruined the dwelling house, but luckily the mill and its machinery were saved. The waterwheel used to drive the millstones was a low-breast shot wheel made mainly of cast iron and wooden cogs. In the 1930s, the mill was a very busy place, active into the early twentieth century. It pressed apples from 1915, ground corn into the 1930s and pumped water until the 1940s when the water tower was built. The mill‚Äôs machinery was also used to drive equipment for pulping and pressing apples for cider. The cider press, apple crusher and some barrels are on display in what was the pump house.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwEc1...-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHhttps://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/AndyWr...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

Charlecote Park (grid reference SP263564) is a grand 16th-century country house, surrounded by its own deer park, on the banks of the River Avon near Wellesbourne, about 4 miles (6 km) east of Stratford-upon-Avon and 5.5 miles (9 km) south of Warwick, Warwickshire, England. It has been administered by the National Trust since 1946 and is open to the public. It is a Grade I listed building.The Lucy family owned the land since 1247. Charlecote Park was built in 1558 by Sir Thomas Lucy, and Queen Elizabeth I stayed in the room that is now the drawing room. Although the general outline of the Elizabethan house remains, nowadays it is in fact mostly Victorian. Successive generations of the Lucy family had modified Charlecote Park over the centuries, but in 1823, George Hammond Lucy (High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1831) inherited the house and set about recreating the house in its original style.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

It is even in my name... Joe Travel Blogs. But it is always so exciting at the start getting to create a new blog from scratch. It is a chance to recreate your own identity! But the problem is you only get to do that once. SO I decided I would help my friend Jack to create his own travel blog for when he goes travelling later in January. This way he gets a chance to share his travels if he wants to and I get the enjoyment of creating a travel blog from scratch again! Surely that is a win for both of us! Later on in the video we also head off to Puzzlewood for a little travel vlog! In order to get some great pictures to fill out his blog!

If you recall my scooter even has suspension!The majority of the West Green House Gardens is flat and suitable for persons with walking difficulties. However the Lake Field parkland has uneven surfaces and some of the paths around the various gardens are gravel and may be difficult for wheelchair users.Refreshments are available from The Tea Room which serves light lunches, cakes, biscuits, tea, coffee and cold drinks. For special occasions, Special Afternoon Teas may be pre-ordered with 24 hours notice.Our toilets are located in the Courtyard Garden. We have one toilet cubicle with wheel chair access.It is a beautiful formal garden laid out around the 18th-century country house at West Green in Hartley Wintney in the English county of Hampshire.

It contains many objects and mementoes of their travels.The extraordinary interior decoration includes a feather frieze, gathered from native game birds and chickens, laboriously stuck down with isinglass.There is also a fragile shell-encrusted gallery, said to contain nearly 25,000 shells, which can be viewed in its entirety using a touch screen 360 degree virtual tour.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHhttps://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/AndyWr...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

240,v_KDI-PGFQU,"Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Max Gate, home of Thomas Hardy","Max Gate, an austere but sophisticated town house a short walk from the town centre of Dorchester, was the home of Dorset's most famous author and poet Thomas Hardy. Hardy, who designed the house in 1885, wanted to show that he was part of the wealthy middle classes of the area, to reflect his position as a successful writer, and to enable him to enter polite society. The house was named after a nearby tollgate keeper called Mack.Many of Hardy's possessions were dispersed before the Trust acquired the house, but we've furnished the rooms for you to enjoy the spaces he created to write and live in. He wrote some of his most famous novels here, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure, as well as much of his poetry.You will find the garden much as it was originally planned, with high walls and large trees encircling the property to preserve Hardy's privacy. The sundial, designed by Hardy, was erected in his memory.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

244,kWmPNhS7jCc,Travel Blogs,"Travel blogs make great reading, but do travel blogs make a good business? Today‚Äôs guest joining us on the Join Up Dots podcast believes in travel, more travel and then when she is finished and wants a bit of rest: Travel. And this is not the pack your bags for two weeks each year, or for as many weekends as you can get, kind of adventure. She is a believer that ‚ÄúYour life does not have to fit in a box. You don‚Äôt have to live behind the picket fence, slave away at that full-time job that sucks you dry, and the monotonous peak hour traffic runs. You can have the picket fence and a job you love of course, but, we‚Äôre pretty sure you at least want to escape your everyday life for weekend getaways or a three-week vacation every year.‚Äù But what is the fascinating thing about today‚Äôs guest, is how close she came to buying into the status quo that life seems to be lived by. Settling into the routine or a life lived on other peoples terms. After meeting each other, falling madly in love and then beginning a five year honeymoon as they travelled the world teaching English, things came to a halt As she says ‚ÄúWe returned home after the honeymoon and hit a major slump. This travel life we loved was over. That thinking changed everything and before we knew it we were chasing money making schemes all over the world trying to get the riches we needed to keep travelling. Let‚Äôs just say $500,000 and no self-esteem later we woke up.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do we need to wait until we have the money to live what‚Äôs in our hearts? Why not just start with what is in the heart today?‚Äù And with that thought, and I‚Äôm sure more than a touch of apprehension they set off on what has become their life, travelling, blogging and helping others to buy into the start the dream today mentality with their top ranked blog ‚ÄúY Travel‚Äù and now with two children in tow, their success, and ability to grab more experiences in a month than most of us have in a lifetime is assured. So what was it about the nomadic lifestyle that had such a pull on them? And is it something that they think everyone can do, or does it take a certain type of mindset? Well lets find out as we bring onto the show to start joining up dots, with the one and only Caroline Makepeace. Show Highlights During the show we discussed such weighty topics with Caroline Makepeace such as: Why the words of Steve Jobs send shivers down her spine, as she has learnt from life that everything works out for the best. You may not know how this will happen but it does. How she is so aware that she can‚Äôt escape the mundane routines of life that everybody else has to deal with, but can make sure that the experiences of life in between are so much better than everyone else. Why it is so important to get back to the things that you really loved as a kid, to build a life around the passion. Doing this helps you push through the hard times so much more easily. How her parents were so supportive with her dream to travel the world, although they would have been very happy for to get a safe job too. And lastly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Why it is so important to watch out for the energy vampires in your life, and to ensure that you pull away as much as possible from the naysayers, and dream slayers.",Travel Blogs

You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel. This is very important as it will prevent any possible strikes against your YouTube channel or videos.- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?*'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception on the internet, and especially here on YouTube.Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase. This gives you the rights to use the music and is also how I earn my living and feed my cat! :)- Do I have to buy a license for every video I make?No, you only need to purchase one 'regular' / standard license in order to use it in all your videos on YouTube, forever. If you wish to use another song, then you'll need to purchase another license for that song. - Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to me in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use my works on your videos, which is also needed if you looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.",Travel Blogs

Jesters Cafe is an Australian franchise that has recently become quite popular in South Korea.  Featuring some of the best pies we've had in Korea, it's no surprise that it can get packed at times with both Koreans and foreigners alike.GEAR WE USEOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7tCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX Olympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM Rode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs SOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/With branches all over the country it's not difficult to locate one near you. Jesters is famous for its meat pies and various kinds of specialty options (including sweet and savoury). We decided to indulge in our two favourites (Blueberry Apple and Maharaja) which we immediately scarfed down.  The pies themselves aren't overly big but they're very filling and high calories.Although we're English teachers in South Korea, our main passion and projects these days revolve around our online travel blogs that we run.  Our is to transition to becoming digital nomads on the road where we tell travel stories, share travel tips, take travel photos and shoot travel videos.  It's honestly far more work than our teaching jobs entail.  In order for us to become successful, we've been blogging late at night after our teaching shifts and often spending a lot of time on the weekends working on random projects related to our sites that we run together.We show you Nomadic Samuel, That Backpacker, Backpacking Travel Blog and Smiling Faces Travel Photos. Of course, no video of ours would be completed without our quirky bloopers at the end.Overall we highly recommend you visit Jesters if you're in Korea for fast wifi and delicious pies -- betcha can't just eat one!http://nomadicsamuel.com/video-blog/t...You're destroying the pie!Today we are having the blueberry kiss, which is blueberry custard inside of a pie and I've turned it into mush but it tastes amazing.That's a big bite.  It's hot!We're at our favorite cafe in my area.  It is a place called Jesters and it is an Australian style cafe. The reason we've come here is so that we can work on our online projects.  We're both basically digital nomads.  We're teachers right now in Korea but we're transitioning to digital nomads and so every weekend on Saturday or Sunday - one day - we come here often.  We come because we get awesome and fast wifi and delicious pies.Here you have my website 'ThatBackpacker.com"" and it is just a random collection of stories and anecdotes and photo essays from my travels.And here is my main site ""NomadicSamuel.com"" and it is a real quirky travel blog featuring a lot of photo essays, travel stories mostly involving self-depreciating humor involving me doing weird wacky stuff and videos.This other site is called ""Backpacking-Travel-Blog.com"" this is one that Sam and I run together and we feature a lot of videos that we make for YouTube and just photo essays and planning trips for upcoming travels - that sort of thing.We like to come here early in the morning because the place is empty as they hardly have any customers so we feel like we're at home in our own little space.  Check it out.  It's a nice little cozy environment.  It is nice and bright, which is something we like.Today I'm going to be working on my site, so first I'm just been reading a few comments that people left that I have to reply to those and then I've been in touch with a few advertisers, so I need to reply to them and perhaps write a few articles.  That is what my Saturday entails.  Busy, busy!  Yes.Aside from the things Audrey mentioned I'll be doing a lot of the same as what she is doing.  I also have a lot of social media platforms I'm going to be rocking on twitter, facebook, stumble upon.And the amount of emails in my inbox makes me want to cry.Alright, take three - no take two!Proudly presented by: http://nomadicsamuel.com , http://smilingfacestravelphotos.com , http://travel-photography-tips.com , http://thatbackpacker.com , http://backpacking-travel-blog.com ,  This video features the song ''Solamente - FrenchLAB"" available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Commercial license.",Travel Blogs

This truly was an amazing STREET FOOD ADVENTURE in INDIA with AMAZING curry, breakfast, and delicious restaurants with UNIQUE Indian food recipes and Indian dinner!If you love eating street food around the world and street food in India, or even all over Asia, you will love the street food in Amritsar. You can find street food everywhere, where everyone seems to cook delicious Indian recipes for curry and SPICY dishes all over the street.‚ñ∫ MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): http://share.epidemicsound.com/pf97L‚ñ∫BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): http://bit.ly/AccessYouTubeinChina‚ñ∫ MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: https://shop.bonfire.com/thefoodranger/In one day, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the PUNJAB style. I didn‚Äôt realize until after we finished eating, but we didn‚Äôt eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!We started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. It‚Äôs stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. It‚Äôs sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. It‚Äôs served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.The next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!Afterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!After this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!After this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.The addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha HutGali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I.

336,E3ykgXDpOZs,HOW I TRAVEL FOR FREE AS A TRAVEL BLOGGER | DUSSELDORF ASSIGNMENT,"In my last video, I talked about how I afford to travel full-time. In that video I talked about how I pay for my travel but I also sometimes travel for free when I'm on a press trip - and today I'm going to show you what that means. I've been travel blogging for nearly 5 years, and during that time I've been on a fair few press trips. If you've been watching my travel videos for a while, you've probably seen content from a couple of those press trips! But I've never really shown you what it's like from behind the scenes.So today we're going to talk about press trips. I want to show you how I travel for free on travel blogger press trips... and why it's not really free at all! Yes, my flights, accommodation, expenses and everything else are paid for when I'm on a press trip. But I still have to pay for it - in time and work. This press trip was a food tour of Dusseldorf, Germany. Each day had a different theme and the theme for the first day of the press trip was ""favourite drinks"". In my next video, I'm going to take you on a full food tour of Dusseldorf, but in this one I just wanted to talk about how press trips work and how I travel the world for free (kind of).",Travel Blogs

[which it seems NOBODY does like I do]But there‚Äôs more...#2 Travel blogging - some cool side income but the real benefit is the awesome perks like free hotel stays, free travel and 1st class upgrades.All completely worth it... You could literally earn a few extra thousand bucks a month and travel lightly if that‚Äôs your thing. It can be that simple...#3 Video Production - Shooting videos for our clients, interviewing them and adding some additional 'B' roll footage and background music.[it's actually a lot easier than most people think with software that already comes loaded on your laptop in most cases]#4 Affiliate Offers - This is a BILLION dollar industry by itself. It's by simply referring offers from companies that I like and use their products myself. Here‚Äôs how it works:When I send emails about it and people buy the offer, I get paid. Its simple to do and no tech skills required for any of these ways I earn income really.#5 Hosting & Speaking at Events - We can charge business owners up to 5K to come to a live, in person workshop where we teach them the simple things that we would normally charge to do for them.Any of these can be learned much easier than you might believe...Here is what you need to know:Jon, a youtube marketer who works with business owners was losing thousands of dollars a month on Facebook Ads......he swallowed his pride and finally confessed this to me......then I taught him a few basic Facebook Ad strategies, and a year later...Over million dollars in revenue.So to get to the point... Do you want me to teach you what I showed Jon how to do as well as my other clients?If so, I'm holding a free training webinar where I will be revealing the exact strategies I taught Jon.Plus, if you sign up for the free webinar, the moment you sign up I‚Äôm going to immediately redirect you to a training video that shows you......what I showed Nathan, my kiwi student... who now generates 5 figures every month and travels the world full time... with a full time income.You can get all of that right here:http://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/[Make sure to get on the list for the free webinar as well]If you have any desire to start a business online from scratch or learn how grow your business with Facebook ads then you need to be on that webinar.I'll see you there,Jubrilhttp://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/",Travel Blogs

With smart design choices such as a strong neck, back and sides made of ABS, the 0 nut, compensated saddle, solid geared tuners, and a rounded back makes this travel ukulele a serious instrument with a great tone.  Come join me as I test out the Flight TUS35 on a hot day on the boat to see if it withstood the hot temperatures and the great outdoors.  Thank you to my Instagram followers that gave me some amazing questions to answer about the Flight TUS35.  I play several ukuleles side by side so that you can compare the tone to other ukuleles made of different tone woods.  CORRECTION!  The graphic for the Grace VanderWaal Signature ukulele was cut off.  It has a glossy finish to look like walnut, but it is laminate sapele.

385,aei2-8UEW4M,Langkawi | Sunset Dinner Cruise with Naam Adventures | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog,"It's a pretty safe bet that I'm going to be signing up for anything that includes wine, a dinner cruise, and an absolutely memorable, picture-perfect sunset.  When I landed on Langkawi and started asking around at the Meritus Pelangi Beach for recommendations on the best cruise operator, the team there shared that they favour Naam and recommended their 3-hour evening dinner cruise on the Sea Falcon so I signed up to go a few days later.  Since I was just one person and staying at the jungle hotel Ambong Ambong (and not one of the main luxury properties they have scheduled pickups at), they provided very swish transfer service in a shiny black sedan that felt wonderfully VIP following days of vans and taxis.Ohhhh and it turns out I was the only non-Chinese guest aboard that night and I had a hoot and a half!  The wine was flowing, the food was actually really yummy, and the ambiance on the Sea Falcon was perfect.  A bit of a party at the beginning, and then we went into a chill-out vibe closer to sunset.NOTE: for the first time in over a year, I accidentally deleted the video footage I shot on my Nikon while transferring files.  So, what you'll see is still fun but it's sadly an 'Angela show' because it's what I shot from my iPhone.  I'm so sad, as I shot some amazing footage that night.  Anyway, do check it out, it's just missing the long shots and food and boat interior images.For more information, links to Naam, and some fun pics visit my travel blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",Travel Blogs

389,x-G5wbAoXSA,Must Know Vietnam Travel Tips to Danang & Hoi An | Vietnam Series Ep. 1,"Vietnam Da Nang and Hoi An Travel Guide and Travel Tips that you must know before you go.  This Vietnam Travel Guide is part of my Vietnam series and we start episode 1 with things you need to know before you go to Danang as well as things you need to know before you go to Hoi An Vietnam.  Da Nang Beach and the Danang Beach resorts are popular destinations and I will help you navigate through the city and give you my favorite tips and tricks.  My Da Nang travel tips are based on what I wish I knew before coming to Da Nang Vietnam as well as Hoi An Vietnam.  There are many things to do in Da Nang but I wanted to focus on the differences of each area, what each specific area offers and general things you must know when coming to danang for the first time.  In fact, Da nang is the fifth largest city in Vietnam and located central part of the country.  IT is locate don the cost of the South China Sea and is one of the most important ports in Vietnam.There are more seafood restaurants options by the Da Nang beach area, like the ones where you get to pick out the live seafood from tanks or buckets and then staff will weigh it out in front of you.  I personally enjoy this process andI think it‚Äôs more reasonably priced.  So if you‚Äôre like me, this beachside may be your best choiceThis Da Nang Vietnam Guide is the first episode of my Vietnam series.  I will be covering Da Nang Vietnamese Street Food, Luxury Hotel and Beach Resorts, Vietnamese Airlines and much more.

401,u5LYl4DM5c4,Street Food in Malaysia - ULTIMATE MALAYSIAN FOOD in Kuala Lumpur!,"Thanks to Oh My Media: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmy...Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every weekT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lHuge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:Mansion Tea StallThe thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plateNasi Lemak TanglinNasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plateIkan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everythingSri Ganapathi MessOne of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 peopleKedai Kopi Lai FoongFinally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowlAgain, thank you to Oh My Media Malaysia for taking us around: https://www.facebook.com/ohmymedia.cc/MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!",Travel Blogs
402,oCjkRzSFckw,Japan Travel Blog: Hakone Day Trip (From Tokyo to Hakone),"Visiting Tokyo? You don't have to restrict your holiday to just within the city, you can also take a day trip to Hakone from Tokyo via Train.Make your way to Odakyu and purchase your tickets from the Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center. The tickets would include whatever you need for the entire day. To get to Hakone, you would have to take the train and change to an uphill tram, before changing to the Hakone Tozan Cablecar which 1st stop would be at Mt Hakone.You would be able to take pictures with this active volcano, and also try their famous black eggs.  Once done, hop back onto the cable car which would take you past a few stops including one that gives you a great view of Mt Fuiji on a good day. Continue on the cablecar till the end to reach the cruise center, where you would board thie gigantic cruise ship which would take you across lake ashi. Take a short stroll and embrace the beauty of the beautiful sakura trees found along the river. A short 15mins walk and you would find yourself at Hakone shrine. Drink from their famous 9 headed dragon basin, visit the fertility tree and also take pictures at the huge tori gate by the lake.Travel Blog: https://livelaughtravel.net/Food Blog: https://livelaughtravel.net/singapore...FB: https://fb.com/livelaughtravelnet/IG: https://instagram.com/livelaughtravel...",Travel Blogs

And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money, or a decent living of it.A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style, which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.Short paragraphs, easy on the eye, kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link, http://sassyzengirl.com/GuestBloggingGuest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:2) Building a large following, both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger, because there is no potential for them to market their products, hotels etc.http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBloggin...This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEOHo to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article, how to perform keyword research, how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results, especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google. SEO Video course:SEO 1 - https://youtu.be/U08NeWHApBUSEO 2 - kw - https://youtu.be/MmdlJi69S7ISEO 3 - OnPage - https://youtu.be/3hTvkkMXuycSEO 4 - OffPage - https://youtu.be/zpTumr0uy2Q 3) You must become a budget travel ninja - know how to travel for free, get paid to travel, get cheap air tickets etchttp://sassyzengirl.com/Budget-Travel...Most importantly, you need to understand that becoming a professional travel blogger means becoming an entrepreneur. You are building a business and a brand and that takes time, mastering new skills and iron determination.Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way, because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out http://theplanetd.com - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.But don't worry - they, too, didn't start big, they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can, too.More Digital Nomad Training Videos:Digital Nomad Jobs - https://youtu.be/3MS6Z9KKOMkKindle Publishing - https://youtu.be/k1UddId7Rw8Entrepreneur Bluprints - https://youtu.be/t0727M7iY4cBuild a blog in 10 min - https://youtu.be/iakdyz5RJDINew Bloggers: Start here - https://youtu.be/b9W-8_jy3fIhttp://facebook.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://twitter.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://pinterest.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://instagram.com/SassyZenGirltravelshttp://google.com/+SassyZenGirltravelshttps://plus.google.com/+SassyZenGirl - NEWhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/Luxury-SEOTravel Videos:Australia - Indian Pacific Train: https://youtu.be/QYoC5k9FYz8#howtobecomeatravelblogger#becometravelblogger#travelblogging#travelblogger#travelbloggingcourse#professionaltravelblogger",Travel Blogs

410,8pbewTbwMzU,Meet Cheryl Howard (Travel Blogger) - In A Minute Portrait (Week 348),"- http://MovingPostcard.com - Canadian Cheryl Howard is an expat and travel blogger, a Berlin Meet-Up organizer and my friend. Cheryl Howard has been living in Berlin for about 5 years - with a Toronto stint in-between. With centrally-located Berlin as her home base, she has found the perfect place to pursue one of her biggest passions: travel. Lucky for us, she shares her travel experiences and tips via her photography and writings on her website http://CherylHoward.com and on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest.Since I met Cheryl in 2012, I've always been impressed by all her travels (especially to the less obvious and touristy destinations), savvy writing, and social media prowess. She's such an inspiration!Because Cheryl Howard loves Budapest so much (and I'm also quite fond of it), I recommend you start exploring her website by checking out one of her posts about Budapest.Another thing that has always impressed me about Cheryl is how outgoing she is. We met when she invited another friend and me, a total stranger, on a Berlin tour in a Calessino. Of course, we became friends, and I made a video about our outing: Berlin Calessino Tour with Expat Bloggers ‚Äì In A Berlin Minute (Week 122).So it's not surprising to me at all that Cheryl recently got into organizing social events...Together with Adam Groffman (of TravelsOfAdam.com), Cheryl organizes a monthly Berlin meet-up called Make Friends in Berlin.  The fun get-togethers encourage newcomers, locals, and expats to meet new people and make friends. To join the fun, check out the Make Friends in Berlin Meetup page and the Make Friends in Berlin Facebook group.The photos in this video show Thailand, Prague, the CSD Parade in Berlin, Cheryl learning to make dumplings in Italy, and Budapest. All these photos are courtesy of Cheryl Howard.Thank you, Cheryl, for inspiring me and others to travel, to be social, to enjoy life and ""to write home"" about it.Also, thank you for meeting me on your lunch hour during my brief Berlin trip this month. Conveniently, Cheryl's day job as an Agile Coach is located just steps from the Museumsinsel (Museum Island) in the river Spree. So we had the perfect Berlin backdrop with the Bode Museum, the Spree and the TV Tower (which dictated my slightly awkward framing).For more information + links, please visit http://movingpostcard.com/cheryl-howard/More exclusive content on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/LuciWestBlog: http://goodhardworkingpeople.blogspot...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MovingPostcardTwitter: http://twitter.com/luciwestFlickr: http://flickr.com/luciwestGoogle+: http://google.com/+MovingPostcardYouTube: http://youtube.com/MovingPostcardYouTube: http://youtube.com/LuciWestTumblr: http://luciwest.tumblr.comVimeo: http://vimeo.com/LuciWestInstagram: http://Instagram.com/LuciWestPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/LuciWest",Travel Blogs

Every village has a market day, lots of dried fish and fresh vegetables. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",Travel Blogs

434,hxraAUbqcEo,24 Hours in MADRID. Madrid Travel Blog,"We spend just 24 hours exploring the beautiful city of Madrid, Spain! We start off in one of the main squares of the city and eventually make our way to the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Sabatini Gardens. Later we take a run through Parque Del Oeste and find the Temple de Debod. As the capital city, a cosmopolitan city, a business center, seat of government, Spanish Parliament, and residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political centre of Spain. Madrid is characterized by intense cultural and artistic activity and a very lively nightlife.---------------SUBSCRIBE! - http://bit.ly/1M4etCO---------------Madrid, SpainAccording to legend the original name of the city was ""Ursaria"" (""land of bears"" in Latin), due to the high number of these animals that were found in the adjacent forests, which, together with the arbutus (""madro√±o"" in Spanish), have been the emblem (The Bear and the Strawberry Tree) of the city from the Middle AgesPaseo del ArteIn English, the Art walk, is a place for beauty and art like no other in Europe. In only 1 kilometre, you will come across one of the most important museums in the world; Prado Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Reina Sofia Museum.  Beside this, you will find gardens, historic streets, science centres and libraries. If you don‚Äôt have enough time, try to go there! You will experience the best Madrid can offer. TOP 5 in Madrid:Puerta del SolPuerta del Sol is one of Madrid‚Äôs most visited squares. The square is surrounded by many small and historical streets such as Calle Arena and others. Puerta del Sol is a great place to start a walk around the most traditional places in Madrid. Cibeles FountainBuilt in 1782, it has become a symbol of the capital. The fountain is built around the Roman goddess Cybele; symbol of the earth, agriculture and fertility. The goddess is depicted being carried by golden lions. Definitely a great palace to visit. Plaza MayorThis square is part of the old part of the city. Plaza Mayor demonstrate the old architecture in Madrid; narrow streets, alleys and passageways, which were once used by swashbuckling swordsmen and medieval rogues.  Plaza Mayor is also well known to be the place for the best open restaurants and bars around this beautiful part of Madrid. Royal PalaceThe largest palace in Europe, this place was home to the majority of the kings of Spain; from Charles III to Alfonso XIII. Nowadays, although the royal family does not longer live there, it is still used during important visits. The best thing about the royals palace; you can visit it yourself. A great way to admire the best of European architecture.

The London Underground is a masterpiece made up of 12 lines that stop at 270 stations in 6 zones. Most tourists will probably stick to Zones 1 and 2, so pay for your tickets accordingly. 3 Ways to Pay for Tube Fare:1. Travel Card - This is a disposal paper ticket that can be valid for a day, a week or even more. 2. Oyster Card - This is a plastic prepaid card that you can put money on and pay as you go. It costs ¬£5, so don't forget to return it when your trip is over. You'll get back the ¬£5 and any remaining balance. 3. Contactless Credit Card - If you have one of these cards, you can use it at the security barriers to tap your way in.

492,GNVUWyvDiCM,"Family Travel Blog-Three Deaf Backpackers- My Heroes, Siem Reap, Cambodia","http://www.thenomadicfamily.comSo, slowly, slowly; we're unraveling a life together, you and I. I talk a lot, and you've become one hell of a great listener. I appreciate that. Anna (the younger one) in Peru spoke of her father's favorite poem. Something about how every man has his first kiss and his first snowfall, and it stuck to me, really snugly. And like you, I have mine. I have my stories that make me who I am, that create the fibers that define where I've been, that push me passed the pain to create who I want to be.But, according to Buddhism, that 'me' is but only an allusion. Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, and it's what we hold onto, to help us define ourselves, label us, categorize and witness our own journey. But, Buddhism teaches that this false sense of self creates boundaries to spirituality and barriers to the true oneness with the world. It's 'me' 'my story' 'my pain' 'my life' and 'you'; likewise, I can stay flapping around lost in the winds of my own self, the way I was, who I was, who I am, who I will be- all false identities I use to mask my true, true non-self, anatta.Of course, remember there's Gabi the traveler who is spiritual, and Gabi and spiritual who is traveling. I get confused. And, here too, ever so slowly, I'm learning how to differentiate them and know which articles to put here on thenomadicfamily and which ones at gabiklaf. So, if you'd like to learn more about spirituality, finding that peace and inner light, anatta (non-self) and ways to find her- go there to gabiklaf. :-) And our tale continues....So, I have a story. And this blog allows me to share that with you, unraveling meticulously, one glorious string at a time, all the fibers that make me me. So, this is part of my story, my life-long fascination has always been deaf people. I fall in love with them, like I fall in love with people who work in book stores (Sheryl), librarians, Momma and Poppa old-fashion stores (especially with art and writing supplies), and firemen (but that's a whole different like of love, we don't have to get into right now). My entire life, I see someone signing and I'm stuck standing there, a bit too closely, with my jaw dropped and fairy dust parading before my eyes. A deaf person signing is the mute piped piper swaying his hands to the beat of the tune only her hears. He and me. So, it all starts like this. Kobi's sitting in the lobby of our hostel here in Siem Reap, Cambodia. He hands me a note (that I still carry in my notebook and look at every few days). It reads: ""I saw your site, loved it. My friends and I admire you guys for what you all are doing. Keep up with the blog and continue to travel the world! ""The note comes from Tandy Lewis, Shayna Unger, and Danielle Berrigan. Hand to heart, I look up. Kobi says, ""They're right over there,"" and I was lost in their music from that moment forth. Forget their kind ways, their shining faces and good looks, their interest in their fellow man, their ability to come right out and say kind things to encourage others; THEY ARE DEAF! That's it, deaf, deaf, deaf, and backpacking. OMG did my kids see mommy go into this strange metamorphosis. Years before we had kids and during a summer when (I can't recall exactly why) but I don't think I was working on the ice cream trucks; I enrolled in American Sign Language 101. It was an intensive 4-hour a day summer course. Walk in, day one, teacher is deaf. Here we go. So, sitting in the lobby in the middle of Cambodia, signing. I touched things that were precious and lost to me. A language I once knew, rather well. A language we had taught our three babies so that they could effectively communicate their needs before their mouth muscles knew how to voice words. We did baby sign in our home for years. And, remarkably fast, it came back. I was standing there talking to these amazing ladies, but not really, really there. I was somewhere else that I'd known long ago, but still can't define. I was in that silent world that somehow lights a voice in my soul that reveals a joy I do not know otherwise. It's a weird magic, and one I am grateful for the girls for bringing out again.Now, Murphy would have it that during the absolutely most endearing (this one or debate ably the 'Angel Outside of Consumerist Hell') interview for me personally, the camera would shut off. So, you only see two minutes of six... Maybe that's meant to show me that my Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, is an allusion, just like my actually recording of this kick-ass, unreal interview was too. Enjoy it, and it's brevity. I did.

They've visited over 50 countries so far and don't plan to stop their long term travel streak anytime soon.  They typically work for 6 months, and then travel for 1 year using the money they earned.  They apply for working holiday visas when visiting Western countries, which is how they manage to work while they travel.  They also buy camper vans when they visit countries where the accommodation is expensive, which allows them to spend next to nothing on accommodation while living in a van (they sell the van at the end of the trip to make their money back), and they also save money by eating out less and not going out drinking every night.On average, the couple spends $10 each per day while backpacking and/or when living the van life.  During their travel time (when they're not working), they go travelling and backpacking in countries where the cost of living is cheap, like India, Nepal, Southeast Asia, Central and South America.We love this couple's sense of curiosity and adventure, and are excited to follow their blog - Non Stop Travelling - and follow them on Instagram, to live vicariously through them while they explore the world.Blog: https://nonstoptravelling.wordpress.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nonstoptrav...Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle -------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: /exploringalternativesblogInstagram: @exploringalternativesMusic & Song Credits: All music in this video was composed, performed, and recorded by Mat Dub√© of Exploring Alternatives.",Travel Blogs

Normally we are backpacking southeast asia, but now we are going through mexico and found an awesome hidden gem called Sayulita. It's a small town in the province of Nayarit and is filled with positive vibes and amazing beaches. There are some beautiful hidden beaches around and all it takes is a bit of water and some wanderlust to venture down the coast and find that perfect gem. Today we took to the beach and went exploring. If I were to give any travel tips or hacks it would be to just get out there and go for it, most often what holds us back is the fear of the unknown. Running a travel blog has really made us step out of our comfort zone and put ourselves in unforgettable situations. Sayulita is a must visit if you are anywhere near it. (Just a short ride from Puerto Vallarta). We are always here to provide you with travel tips, tricks and hacks so feel free to reach out if you have any backpacking questions. So far vlogging in Mexico has been amazing and we totally recommend it.

A little bit about myself: I live in San Diego and love all things creative. I am a webmaster for work but do all sorts of things including design, photography and anything that involves using my hands or creativity.My wife and I are avid rock climbers and love go to on adventures in our 88 Vanagon.

You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options, but I‚Äôll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.  (1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.  (2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.  It doesn‚Äôt have a daily transfer limit which I personally prefer.  And if I use up all the data in only a few days, you can just buy a new card.

It‚Äôs the home of the fashionable hygge concept and was voted the most bike friendly city in Europe. It feels like home. That feeling where you can‚Äôt describe why‚Ä¶ but the vibrancy of the people, and the coziness of culture‚Ä¶its just a place you won‚Äôt forget in a hurry! Coming up we‚Äôre gonna help you get around the city, learn some of the basic lingo, try some Danish delicacies, and give you some useful tourist tips but first of all we‚Äôre starting at the airportCopenhagen airport is the largest in Scandinavia. It‚Äôs clean, modern and super efficient. From here the best ways to get into town are to take the metro or a taxi.Metro platforms are at terminal three and all trains go into town, so no need to worry about getting the wrong one. Ticket machines only accept cards or coins, not notes - so watch out for that. Taxis are available outside arrivals, costing around ¬£35 and it takes about 20 minutes to get into town.Copenhagen is one of the most bike friendly cities in Europe. So, grab a bike from one of the many places you can rent them here, get in the cycle lane, and go and tour the city in one of the most authentic ways possible.We found a rather fantastic app while in Copenhagen. Donkey Republic allows you to hire a bike right from your phone almost anywhere in the city. Each bike is unlocked with bluetooth, so just select your location, find your numbered bike and away you go.",Travel Blogs

Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess‚Äô anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.",Travel Blogs

Talatamaty City is home to one of the country‚Äôs largest local morning markets, Tsena‚Äôny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics.

TALATA VOLON‚ÄôONDRY: Sausage + KobaADDRESS: Talata Volon‚Äôondry OPEN: Varies Talata Volon‚Äôondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar‚Äôs national snack, koba. ü•îSAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. üá≤üá¨KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.üí∏PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -üí¨COME SAY HI:INSTAGRAM ¬ª http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)FACEBOOK ¬ª http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebooküíóSUPPORT OUR MISSION:Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

Honestly, how does one decide which tea to sip when the selection is so beautifully mixed? Well, why sip just one when I could be naughty and try four? So I did. That, and indulge in an awe-inspiring selection of savoury and sweet treats that turned this High Tea into the highlight of my week!Why You‚Äôll Love Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:- The food is to-die-for delicious. I don‚Äôt have a single complaint or even note from my visit, it was all perfect- A quartet in white tuxedo jackets plays the prettiest music you can imagine ‚Äì from iconic 50s love songs to popular songs playing on the radio today. Think Breakfast At Tiffany‚Äôs meets Taylor Swift. They made the ambiance perfectly magical- Their exclusive tea blend is named ‚ÄòThe Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Blend‚Äô and it is a mix of Chinese Tie Kuan Ying (tea served to royalty since the Tang dynasty) and green Oolong that is smooth and creamy, and smells of white flowers to me. I loved it!- They serve fruit infusions for those looking to avoid the caffeine kick- TIP for Vegetarians (or anyone with special dietary needs): You will LOVE their VIP service!

584,2DgICLDyHpU,Exploring Urk - Travel Vlog (Video Blog) Travel Netherlands üá≥üá±,"A guide to Urk, this is our second vlog (video blog) about Urk, a small fishing town in the ""bible belt"" of The Netherlands that still maintains its past traditions.More at http://secretsofaworldtraveller.com/2...Urk is a typical city were traditions from past still stand strong today. Especially on days like Urkerdag or Vlaggetjesdag people dress up in traditional clothing and perform chores and other things like they did back in the day. Urk is a very religious city and almost all inhabitants are or were fishermen. One of the traditions that still is going strong on a daily basis is men wearing golden earrings with ships on the waves. Some of them also have an earring with their name in the other ear. This tradition stems from back in the day when men from Urk drowned while at sea they would get a proper burial paid for by the city if they had gold in their ears. On days like Urkerdag or Vlaagetjesdag you can eat smoked salmon, smoked eel, fried kibbeling, salted raw herring and so on. But you can also buy things for your boat, old jewelry, cutlery, plates, and other knick-knacks. It is amazing to get a glance of this otherwise so closed community. While we were there we found out what Urk means and where it comes from. Urk used to be an island, until the former Zuiderzee became the lake IJsselmeer. It‚Äôs best known as a fishing village. At the harbor there is always loads of activity going on. You enjoy the action from a distance on one of the many terraces. The same harbor also offers all kinds of water sports opportunities.Highlights of UrkUrk's history goes back over one thousand years. Visit the old village and you can still feel the history it holds. Enjoy the beautiful surroundings by walking through the old village or from the water by boat. It‚Äôs highly recommended to eat some fresh fish in the harbor. You can also enjoy excellent fish dishes at one of the local restaurants. The nearby eel farm and a trip over the lake with the tourist line to Enkhuizen are also highly recommended.Visit UrkUrk is a small village with a great history, ideal for lovely walks. Charming shops, museums, beach, harbor and pool are within walking distance. Do note that the tourist line between Enkhuizen and Urk only sails in summertime. Most inhabitants of Urk consider Sunday a day of rest, so it‚Äôs best to visit Urk on weekdays or on a Saturday.Facts via Holland.comWebsite: http://secretsofaworldtraveller.comFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/secretsofawo...Twitter: https://twitter.com/SWorldTravellerGoogle Plus: https://plus.google.com/+Secretsofawo...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""A Month in China"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmTRg...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",Travel Blogs

Filmed in Vicenza, ItalyCopyright Mark Wolters 2016The Don'ts of Italy1. Don't expect to get discount prices on fancy Italian luxury brands. 2. Don't eat near tourist sights. You will be ripped off and not get as good of Italian food as you would away from the tourist sights.  3. Don't Tip. They already charge you for service. 4. You Don't have to scream louder to get people to understand you. 5. Don't worry about overdressing, the Italians will always look better than you.6. Don't just visit Rome and Venice, there is so much more to Italy. 7. Don't share your pizza and make sure you do eat it with your fork and knife.8. Don't use the fast trains for short distances, they are not worth the significantly higher prices. 9. Don't expect to see spaghetti and meatballs on the menu TOGETHER. They will be there separately, but not together. 10. Don't expect a big breakfast in Italy. Just coffee and a cookie. 11. Don't overpack. You will be limited on space when traveling in Italy so pack accordingly. 12.

597,7uY0Ab5HlZ0,Toronto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Toronto.d17831...Welcome to Toronto, the largest city in Canada and a hub of trade and culture.‚ÄúThe City That Works‚Äù is full of a can-do spirit that is reflected in its buildings. From the famous CN Tower to the castle-like Casa Loma, there‚Äôs all sorts of eye candy for the architecture enthusiast. Your Toronto tour should include a trip to Edward Gardens in Hyde Park, or one of the many other green spaces located in the city. Take a bike ride along the trails, or enjoy a picnic while the local chipmunks look on. Don‚Äôt drop anything; they‚Äôll grab it.Your Toronto sightseeing can continue at the Harborfront Center. Go for a walk along the marina, or grab a pint at a brewhouse. And no trip to Toronto is complete without a visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame, so make sure you‚Äôve got your team paraphernalia in order before you venture inside. Looking for shopping? You‚Äôll find the Underground City and Kensington Market ready to welcome you and your credit card ‚Äì or several credit cards, as the case may be. After a day of madcap purchasing, why not stock up on fresh, healthy food at the St. Lawrence Market? You‚Äôll have worked up quite an appetite for delicious local produce. Before you leave, head to Niagara Falls and take in the spectacle of nature‚Äôs power. You‚Äôll never forget the sight and sound of all that water pouring over the falls, nor will you ever forget your trip to Toronto.

Beaming, shining, gushing about how really nothing at all brings me enormous joy. And here, we've been invited by friends to a festival. Authentic, genuine, super cool. We were the only, only, only non-locals there, and I love those moments. When we are just honored enough, lucky enough to be around kind-hearted people who extend an invitation of love to us. By the way, my hair looks unbelievably stunning.( I know it's not related to anything I am trying to share with you, but a- my vanity is alas, mine and b- my mind does that four hundred times a second). I loved that short little period of time between attempt number one and attempt number two for purple hair. When I got the most-amazing-I-have-ever-gotten-in-my-life-haircut. . I looked soooo good. Now, sitting here in Cambodia with my fried-bleach-blonde-highlights-after-the-purple-attempt-number-two-faded hair and thinking how much I'd love that amazing hairdresser in Lima, Peru to fix my hair up again. These days it is in a bun or a ponytail all day. Advantages to that are that now my family can tell me all day, ""Girl, yo ponytail from the back looks riDicUlous! ""So, where were we.... annoying-as-hell fly won't leave me alone. I am practicing ahima (nonharm to all beings) so trying not to swat it to DEATH! but it won't let me be. It will end up being one of those ,""Look what you made me do!"" tragedies in my life.

615,hZbhALpp3qo,How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or Instagram,"How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or InstagramWhen you think of your job as a travel blogger, it's ultimately to provide value to your readers. It's normal human behavior to want to talk about lots of different topics, but in order to be a successful travel blogger or influencer, you need to consider perfecting your niche. Think of all the successful travel bloggers you love and look up to. Are they talking about tons of different topic, or really zoning in on a few in particular? 9/10 - they have travel as the umbrella, but are focusing on 2 or 3 sub niches (adventure, culinary, motivation)If you're using SEO tactics to drive traffic to your blog, you want to ensure that the person that comes to your blog for the first time, knows what to expect. If you have posts on motherhood, travel, fitness and fashion, you will most likely lose them as a loyal follower. While they may be interested in all these topics, they found your site via search, and are looking for more topics that cover this area. In today's video, I'll talk more about why getting niche will transform your travel blog or instagram, and tactics on how to get started!Relevant Blog Post: https://sidewalkerdaily.com/travel-bl...::::::Sidewalker Daily is committed to bridging the gap between travel brands and content creators by providing unparalleled support and educational resources on best industry practices.

625,gGmSLwp-3Zo,"Family Travel Blog- New Look at Numbers, Sex, & Manly Wallets- Siem Reap, Cambodia","http://www.thenomadicfamily.comI know, I know. What in God's name are we talking about now? I know. But it was really interesting how they write their numbers (so cool), and really awkward what to say when your son starts having sex with his fingers in the middle of a restaurant (did I sound cool about it?), and well, Kobi did get a new manly wallet. I love it when men use pink. It just shows that you are man enough to pull it off, being feminine. So, it's 2:35 am in Cambodia and you could say I need to go to sleep. I just submitted, per request, my featured article for the largest Israeli online news website, with a million and a half readers a day. OMG! OMG! OMG! For a country with a population of 7 million, with maybe 5 million Jews; a million and a half readers of day is beyond huge. I'm thinking an astounding forth of the people of Israel read this online news source daily, and we're going to be the cover featured article in the Family section for the Jewish New Year! And, maybe we'll get a regular column with them. For an Israeli, this is like the New York Times. Seriously. So, I wrote that today and sent it in; and I""m working passionately to write and schedule enough posts to have both blogs running until October 10th. I'll be gone for two weeks from September 11- September 26ish, and we want to have blog blogs securely in place, while I""m gone. What will I be doing you ask?Getting my spiritual ass kicked into the next life. Ten hours a day of sitting- no writing, talking, walking, sleeping; no, but sitting for ten hours a day and meditating. Dear God, oh the storms of my soul that are about to arise. I await this deep scrubbing with all of my heart, and am terrified from it at the same accord. Can I? How will I? I'll let you know when I'm done, and clean.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.

At only 20 pounds the limber quadruped can bend and swing its legs wide, enabling it to walk either right side up or upside down. The robot can also trot over uneven terrain about twice as fast as an average person's walking speed.

658,dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,"It‚Äôs an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new ‚Äúthings‚Äù and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ‚Äô90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you‚Äôre a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays.

So what kind of knowledge are we talking about?From the standpoint of current evolutionary theory, the human race is supposed to be at the top of the society development. However, according to the Vedic literature, in a distant past there have been civilizations in the world, the greatness of which we cannot even imagine.A detailed study of the Vedic texts was held in Bombay in 1975.It was a scientific ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù in physicist circles when the scientists have discovered the vivid description of subatomic level in the Vedas written some five thousand years ago.The Mahabharata, an ancient historical epic, describes the use of nuclear weapons as follows:‚ÄúIt was as if all the nature‚Äôs forces have been suddenly unleashed. Something dazzling like the sun revolved in circles. Burned with a heat of this weapon, the world was staggering, as in a fever.Elephants caught fire from the heat and rushed wildly hither and thither in search of protection from the terrible power. Water in the sea turned hot, the animals were dying, the foes were killed and trees were falling in rows under the fury of the forest fire. Elephants blew their trunks fiercely and fell dead on the ground. Horses and chariots were burned on the spot.Thus, thousands of enemy chariots were destroyed, and then deep silence descended on the sea. Wind began to blow and the earth shined. It was a terrible sight. The corpses of the fallen were mutilated by terrible heat so that they no longer resembled people. Never before have we seen such a terrible weapon and did not hear about it. ‚Äù (Drona-parva)The Vedic texts contain a large number of descriptions of different types of weapons, ranging from primitive stone throwing slings (sarvatobhadra), wall smashing mechanisms (udghatima), to all sorts of high velocity dart throwing devices (yantra-sara), and ending with weapons which damaging force does not have modern analogues.The tenth canto of Bhagavata Purana describes the various battles with weapons of extraordinary power. Those battles were fought by our ancient ancestors inhabited the planet, as well as representatives from other worlds.It is obvious that our ancestors were much more highly developed than we are today. Comparing to them we look like babies, at least in technical terms.It appeared that the city was well-protected even in terms of today‚Äôs scientific advancement.In Vedic literature there are many references to flying saucers. In general, they are called the vimana. Vimanas in the Vedas are divided into two categories:1) the mechanical machines, similar to airplanes and flying with wings like a bird;2) and very complex machines that can not be precisely classified, which had unlimited possibilities.Machines of the first category are described mainly in medieval writings in Sanskrit, along with other various automatic devices and military machines.There were robots designed in the form of male and female figures that performed various functions. They were made mostly of wood, but perfectly covered with humanlike skin. Their motions were provided by the system of bolts, iron rods, springs and grooves. These figures played musical instruments, served drinks to guests and did other similar services.Yantrapurusha or man-machine could behave exactly like a real human. It is described in Bhagaya-vastu how an artist visited home of the yantracharya, or a teacher of mechanical engineering. There he was met by a robot-girl who washed his feet and had a resemblance of a real person until he realized that she was unable to speak. However, it is known that there were even speaking and absolutely fantastic sounding robots.Are we able now, with all our modern science and computer technology, to repeat a similar level of inventive skill?

724,X_ESxckVR7M,"Master of Technology Management: Engineering, Science and Entrepreneurship","For more information: http://www.mtm.ucsb.eduThe best technology-based companies don't have a hard time finding employees to work on technical projects and investors see no shortage of entrepreneurs with good ideas for products but executives and investors both agree that they can't often find engineers and scientists who have what it takes to build the business around their new technologies. When looking to develop business and management skills, engineers and scientists are faced with an unfortunate decision between two choices: hope there's some day given a chance to develop leadership abilities on the job or to get an MBA and risk losing touch with their technical roots.  At UC Santa Barbara we've created a third choice--a better choice.  The UC Santa Barbara's Master of Technology Management Program was built with chief one important goal: to catapult early career engineers toward becoming leaders in technology ventures, both within established companies and startups.  To build the Master of Technology Management Program we asked dozens of large technology companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, Tesla, JDS Uniphaseas well as founders of many small tech startups what skills engineers and scientists need to become successful entrepreneurs and effective change agents within large firms then we carefully crafted a curriculum that help students to develop those skills in just nine months. Our Master of Technology Management Program is geared specifically to teach students about how to lead technical ventures both new companies and established technology companies.We focus with laser precision on thinking about how do you manage technical enterprise and technical workers.  The MTM curriculum provides the frameworks and skills that will allowyou to comfortably tack between start-up activities within established companies and start-up activities as an entrepreneur.  Our program focuses on the intersection of Technology Management where people products and processes meet.  Work is all about collaboration. Very few things are individual effort the hardest projects we do at Sonos are around getting the highly cross functional teams working and collaborating well together. That was a huge skill I learned at UCSB.  Our award-winning faculty is composed of nationally recognized scholars andteachers in the field of technology management who have invested in, founded, lead and consulted for tech ventures.  Their real-world experiences allow them to speak directly to issues that students will face in their jobs.  Our core faculty is fully committed to the development of our Master of Technology Management students. That means office hours, extracurricular events, even hallway conversations are centered on you and your classmates.  We accept only the most talented and highly qualified early career engineers and scientists from around the world.  We look for individuals who have distinguished themselves as technology experts and have demonstrated leadership potential.  You'll be moving through the nine-month intensive curriculum as a single cohort with smart, ambitious individuals just like you.  UC Santa Barbara's technology management program is the only management program in the world designed exclusively for engineers and scientists.  If your ideal career path is one in which you build technology,  focus leadership skills on top of your existing technical talents,  this is the program for you.  Today's tech companies are looking for tomorrow's leaders.  Will you be ready to meet the demand?  To learn more or to submit an application, visit us at mtm.ucsb.edu today.",Science and Technology

Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture, biomass, ocean wind and salinity, etc. However, until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also, a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.For more lectures on demand visit:http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/in...",Science and Technology

774,X_ESxckVR7M,"Master of Technology Management: Engineering, Science and Entrepreneurship","For more information: http://www.mtm.ucsb.eduThe best technology-based companies don't have a hard time finding employees to work on technical projects and investors see no shortage of entrepreneurs with good ideas for products but executives and investors both agree that they can't often find engineers and scientists who have what it takes to build the business around their new technologies. When looking to develop business and management skills, engineers and scientists are faced with an unfortunate decision between two choices: hope there's some day given a chance to develop leadership abilities on the job or to get an MBA and risk losing touch with their technical roots.  At UC Santa Barbara we've created a third choice--a better choice.  The UC Santa Barbara's Master of Technology Management Program was built with chief one important goal: to catapult early career engineers toward becoming leaders in technology ventures, both within established companies and startups.  To build the Master of Technology Management Program we asked dozens of large technology companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, Tesla, JDS Uniphaseas well as founders of many small tech startups what skills engineers and scientists need to become successful entrepreneurs and effective change agents within large firms then we carefully crafted a curriculum that help students to develop those skills in just nine months. Our Master of Technology Management Program is geared specifically to teach students about how to lead technical ventures both new companies and established technology companies.We focus with laser precision on thinking about how do you manage technical enterprise and technical workers.  The MTM curriculum provides the frameworks and skills that will allowyou to comfortably tack between start-up activities within established companies and start-up activities as an entrepreneur.  Our program focuses on the intersection of Technology Management where people products and processes meet.  Work is all about collaboration. Very few things are individual effort the hardest projects we do at Sonos are around getting the highly cross functional teams working and collaborating well together. That was a huge skill I learned at UCSB.  Our award-winning faculty is composed of nationally recognized scholars andteachers in the field of technology management who have invested in, founded, lead and consulted for tech ventures.  Their real-world experiences allow them to speak directly to issues that students will face in their jobs.  Our core faculty is fully committed to the development of our Master of Technology Management students. That means office hours, extracurricular events, even hallway conversations are centered on you and your classmates.  We accept only the most talented and highly qualified early career engineers and scientists from around the world.  We look for individuals who have distinguished themselves as technology experts and have demonstrated leadership potential.  You'll be moving through the nine-month intensive curriculum as a single cohort with smart, ambitious individuals just like you.  UC Santa Barbara's technology management program is the only management program in the world designed exclusively for engineers and scientists.  If your ideal career path is one in which you build technology,  focus leadership skills on top of your existing technical talents,  this is the program for you.  Today's tech companies are looking for tomorrow's leaders.  Will you be ready to meet the demand?  To learn more or to submit an application, visit us at mtm.ucsb.edu today.",Science and Technology

783,Nh_I2UOZFQ0,Will science and technology save the world?,"The green revolution in agriculture has freed hundreds of millions around the world from the risk of starvation. The Internet is providing knowledge-on-tap to people as never before. Lifespans have doubled due to remarkable progress in medicine. New desalination techniques are poised to solve problems of shortage of fresh water. Our remaining resource problems can be solved by synthetic biology, nanoscale molecular manufacturing, and asteroid mining. The threat of climate change can be tamed by carbon capture and geoengineering. Although doomsayers are distracted by rolling news stories that highlight human failings in graphic terms, the big picture is that science and technology are changing the world into a much better place. Right?Not every futurist is convinced by this techno-optimistic narrative. Here's a forceful critique by renowned speaker, blogger, and interviewer, Nikola Danaylov:[Quote]I am tired of hearing that science and technology will save the world.It is almost the same as saying ‚ÄúJesus will save you!‚ÄùIt evokes the very same passive quasi-religious hope that something or someone out there will magically solve all our problems, bring abundance in our lives, help us live forever and bring back the dead.I am sorry to break this to you but science and technology will not save the world. Never have...Our civilization is like an alcoholic with a failing liver ‚Äì we hope we can 3d bio-print a new one just in time, while failing to acknowledge our self-destructive habits and our own responsibility, thereby failing to address the actual problem, rather than the symptom.It‚Äôs like hoping to win the lottery ‚Äì it‚Äôs not totally impossible, but it is almost certain we won‚Äôt. (And even if we do, then what? It will only provide more time, not necessarily a solution.)And so we sit, and wait, and hope for science and technology to come save the world. And we are getting both fat and lazy as we are eating and driving ourselves to death. Both personally and collectively.[End Quote](You can read more of Nikola's article at https://www.singularityweblog.com/tec....)In this London Futurists online video conference, a number of futurists from around the world debated questions such as:*) What are the risks of over-reliance on technology?*) What are the risks of under-reliance on technology?*) What goals should be set for the use of science and technology?*) To what extent is it desirable to try to regulate the development and use of technology?*) What are the most effective methods to steer the development of technology?

Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture, biomass, ocean wind and salinity, etc. However, until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also, a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.For more lectures on demand visit:http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/in...",Science and Technology

What does the future of Singapore's food security look like and what lessons can we learn from our global counterparts? Singapore is not generally thought of as an agricultural nation. Its land-scarcity means that it is challenging for urban Singapore to accommodate large scale traditional farming. Can advances in indoor agri-technology make local production a more viable option?Tan Poh Hong explores Singapore's roadmap for food security and how science and technology and the urban food revolution may transform the country's food production.",Science and Technology

After that much advancement in medical science, there  are some areas which are interesting but devastating because yet medical science is not able to cure them. Genetic disorder is one among those. A genetic disorder is a genetic problem caused by one or more abnormalities formed in the genome. Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions. Genetic disorders may be hereditary, meaning that they are passed down from the parents' genes. From a long time neuroscience trying to give the answer to fix this bizarre human body disorder but until now nothing has been discovered. Amazing Crispr treatment can help researchers to change dna structure by gene editing. This technique gave medical science a quite boost in gene therapy which enable scientist to treatment people in real life. And also advancement in this technology can lead us to a future where we can perform dna replication. Our investigation in different medical schools lead us to the shocking discoveries and research of medical science.

During various excursions around China and especially Liaoning Province, research was done and cultural, social as well as historical aspects included in the schematic design. Interactive exhibits as well as a functional design concept were chosen, specifically adapted to and arranged for a high-class exhibition hall, featuring more than 150 exhibits on an area of 3.500 sqm. The arrangement and the exhibits were then defined more precisely to meet the highest international standards of exhibition design. Support during the tendering phase, construction consultancy and installation support were additional tasks in this exciting and challenging project.¬© Kurt H√ºttinger GmbH & Co.

Watch this chat show as Part 1 of 2 videos.Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.HKUST has modern buildings, it has a very modern large campus, compared to the other Asian universities like NTU, HKU. It has a beautiful campus, right next to the sea so they enjoy both the hilly aspect as well as the seas side aspect. They have a small beach on campus too. They play soccer on the field which is right next to the sea, they sometimes have to jump in and fetch the ball. The residence halls are facing the sea as well, half of them. There are about 2000 students in each year, including 800 students in the Engineering School.One of the big advantages of studying at HKUST is the low cost. HKUST offers many scholarships to students. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you have done IB, ICSE or CBSE, everyone can get a scholarship, only the amounts vary depending upon your grade 11 and Grade 12 marks. There is a page on the website devoted to scholarships for IB students. If you get over 35 out of 45 points in IB you are eligible for a scholarship. If you apply early, a 42 gives you a full scholarship and if you apply regular a 45 gets you a scholarship.The cost is around HKD 120,000 for international students and HKD 40,000 for local students. The government funds each child, whether they are local or international. Even the living costs are very low in Hong Kong ‚Äì approx. HKD 15,000 ‚Äì 20,000 per year which is very low.Mechanical Engineering is a tough program. It has an intense workload and courses are offered only once a year so you have to plan your courses in a way that you do not have to take an extra semester at the end of the four years. Mechanical Engineering has the most number of required credits as compared to other degrees.  You need to do 15 credits a semester to complete your requirements. And extra courses if you want to do a minor. Ansh intends to do a minor in business. The mechanical department offers options, you can do three courses in one area to call that your option, he is doing an option in in sustainable energy. There is a lot of flexibility allowed. HKUST has a core requirement of 36 courses out of the required 120. These include math, comp science, history, science and technology ‚Äì any field or any major. The course allows you to take any course as long as you fulfil the requirements of that course.Ansh enjoyed a course in history in his first year and last summer he took a course in bitcoins that he thoroughly enjoyed. That was his favourite class. Discussion based class with external speakers was interesting.The activities that he is engaged in outside the classroom are diverse ‚Äì he is the financial secretary of the art club, the internal secretary of the cuisine society.  He works with the sustainability unit, as part of the sustainability leadership program at his school he is working on a solar panel project and is now a mentor for students pursuing projects in sustainable energy. He also trains with the school track and field team and runs long distance running like 5 kms and cross country. He also plays football for the mech engineering team. He tries lots of new sports like kickboxing. HKUST has an Undergraduate research orientation program which is considered one of the best in Asia. They have a lot of funding from the government and infrastructure available to do research. Ansh has been pursuing research for the past one year under a professor on Energy harvesting.HKUST (UST) has really good sport infrastructure too, they have a football field, running track near the sea, an indoor football court too, 8 tennis courts, squash courts, badminton courts, indoor gym, table tennis tables, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, multi purpose hall for martial arts.  Student body is international compared to the Asian universities. 80% of the students are local Hong Kong students since it is government funded, 10% are mainland china students. 10% of the student body is international. This largely includes Philipines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, India students but in recent years they have had lots of Europeans and Americans coming in for the experience. There are students from all around the world. Also the 80% Hong Kong students are diverse. They could be from all over the world but grew up in Hong Kong and are classified as Hong Kong Locals.Please Watch Part 2 of 2 coming soonVideo Chat with Ansh NastaHost - Chetna VasishthWe are on -YouTube.com/c/ChetChatFacebook.com/chetchat101Twitter - @chetchat101Instagram - chetchat101Google.com/+/ChetChatchetchat101@gmail.comchetchat101.tumblr.com vimeo.com/chetchataffimity.com/u/chetchat",Science and Technology

918,t-83IhbzeCE,Do science and technology bring about happiness? | Chip Tsao | TEDxWanChai,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Within the context of China‚Äôs push for modernisation over the last three decades, Chip highlights the ways technology has impinged on traditional Chinese values, and calls for increased debates to be brought back into families and classrooms. ‚ÄÉChip Tsao is a columnist and broadcaster in Hong Kong who has written on a wide range of subjects, many of which relate to the comparison of China with Western countries. Chip is a renowned writer in Hong Kong, where his iconic column in HK magazine titled ‚ÄúPolitical Incorrectness‚Äù has garnered him much media attention for its satirical tone and often controversial views. In his early life, Chip gained a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in English from Warwick University and later gained a postgraduate diploma from London School of Economics and Political Science. He began his career as a journalist in the United Kingdom, initially reporting for the BBC World Service during the Cold War, and later deputy editor of Eastern Express during the final years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. Having lived both in the West and the East, Chip considers himself a global citizen.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Science and Technology

He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s, including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‚Äòclean coal technologies‚Äô, links between provincial level research and policy making, and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China‚Äôs changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‚Äòcatching up‚Äô of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China‚Äôs emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration, his talk charts the country‚Äôs ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it.

It has a history dating back to the year of 1933 with Shanghai as its original location. In 1953, the University grew into the first shipbuilding school in P.R. China and was relocated in 1970 to Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province. In 1978 and 1993, the University was upgraded and renamed twice, respectively called as Zhenjiang Shipbuilding Institute and East China Shipbuilding Institute. In 2004, after the incorporation of Jianghai Trade School and Sericulture Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the University under its current name came into existence.     With its primary location in the scenic and historical Zhenjiang city, the University now occupies four purpose-built campuses, which cover more than 427 acres in total. It currently manages the delivery of undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs through 14 schools and 1 institute. By far, the University has set up 59 undergraduate programs, 6 doctoral programs, and 48 master degree programs. There are more than 1,164 faculty members including 156 professors, 494 associate professors, 344 doctoral degree holders and more than 200 faculty members who have overseas experience.

963,V66feYKy6_A,"Stephen Hawking: Science & Technology Lecture, Interview - Education (1998)","Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (born 8 January 1942) is an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology within the University of Cambridge. His books: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=U...His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.Hawking is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. Hawking was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009.Hawking has achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his book A Brief History of Time stayed on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.Hawking suffers from a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig's disease, that has gradually paralysed him over the decades. He communicates using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device. Hawking married twice and has three children.At the release party for the home video version of the A Brief History of Time, Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on Star Trek, learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact, and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993.[306][307][308] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song ""Keep Talking"",[309][234] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons.[310] Hawking appeared in documentaries entitled The Real Stephen Hawking (2001),[296] Stephen Hawking: Profile (2002) [311] and Hawking (2013), and the documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008).[312] Hawking has also guest-starred in Futurama[72] and The Big Bang Theory.[313] Hawking allowed the use of his trademarked voice in the biographical 2014 film The Theory of Everything.[314]Hawking has used his fame to advertise products, including a wheelchair,[296] National Savings,[315] British Telecom, Specsavers, Egg Banking[316] and Go Compare.[317]Hawking has received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). At that time, his nomination read:     ""Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on ""Space-time in the Large"". The citation continues:     ""Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors.""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_...",Science and Technology

990,PzPW5msevJ0,15 Recent Science Discoveries You Wont Believe,"15 amazing recent discoveries in the world of science and here they are from bionic contact lenses to reanimating dinosaur dna!Subscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr7.  New Human SpeciesBiologists all over the world were intrigued upon hearing the 2015 discovery of a new species of human, Homo Naledi, allowing for an ever clearer picture of our ancient ancestry.  The findings were unveiled deep in an underground cave in South Africa and is considered one of the greatest collection of human remains ever unearthed.  So far, it is known that this species of human grew to an average height of 5 feet and had a brain no larger than an orange.  The way the bones in the South African cave were arranged suggests that these human ancestors ritualistically buried their dead, giving scientists a glimpse into our cultural past.6.  Bionic LensWhile still in the testing stage, the founder of Ocumetics Technology Corp may have stumbled upon a revolutionary technology that could augment the way humans perceive the world.  A new bionic contact lens will give wearers an ability to see the world with stronger than 20/20 vision.  Some subjects, who have already tried the lens themselves, claim that they not only see better than ever before but have identified a unique spectrum of colors unfamiliar to the unaided eye.  Is this perhaps the first step in the direction of a new era of superhumans?5.  Harder Than Diamond Scientists may have recently discovered a substance harder than diamond, Q-carbon.  What gives diamonds their excellent hardness are the chemical bonds that hold them together.  The carbon in diamonds is held together by incredibly tight chemical bonds at the microscopic level, giving diamonds their prominent hardness.  By the manipulation of carbon atoms, scientists were able to augment their chemical bonds, producing a material that is potentially 60 times harder than diamond.  While this substance is still being experimented on, it is a potential prospect for the future of cheap, efficient technologies.4.  First MammalsResearchers from the University of Edinburgh have discovered an ancient species of mammals that survived the notorious extinction of the dinosaurs over 65 million years ago.  The reason this find is so significant is that it gives us a glimpse at how mammals began to rule the world previously dominated by their cold-blooded counterparts.  The mammal is thought to have been a plant-eater closely resembling a modern beaver.  Once the dinosaurs were eliminated these beaver-like creatures began to flourish, given that they were no longer victims of dinosaur predators.  Because these little guys were able to withstand the destruction that wrecked havoc on the dinosaurs, an array of mammals, including our ancestors, were finally able to leave their mark on the world. 3.  Whale Gene MappingGene mapping is starting to look less like a theoretical nicety and more like an applied science with this new aquatic discovery.  Scientists have finally discovered why Bowhead Whales are able to live to 200 years old by remapping their entire genome.  By comparing the genome of Bowhead Whales with the genome of other mammals with a less impressive lifespan, scientists were able to point out marked differences.  Bowhead longevity is due to its genes‚Äô effectiveness in repairing gene deterioration, which is the cause of cancer and other ailments known to cut human life short.  By further studying this animal‚Äôs genes, scientists may finally be able to restore our own faulty genetic system, substantially lengthening our lives. 2.  Second Earth NASA has recently confirmed their discovery of a possible second Earth.  Kepler-452b orbits its sun in what scientists call the ‚ÄúGoldilocks Zone,‚Äù which is the habitable region in space, not too far or close to the sun, necessary for the possibility of life to flourish.  The new planet appears to have a rocky surface as well as liquid water, which is another key ingredient for life to subsist.  Although not much is known about if there is life beyond Earth, it makes sense to take notice of planets similar to our own.1.  Animal Re-animationScientists have always been intrigued by the prospect of re-animating creatures that have been extinct for many years.  While bringing a dinosaur back to life would be kind of cool, bringing a Wooly Mammoth back to life would be just as cool, and that is just what scientists are trying to do.  Because Wooly Mammoths and Saber-Toothed Tigers have only been extinct for tens of thousands of years, unlike the millions of years dinosaurs have been extinct, intact DNA samples are much easier to find.  Scientists believe it is possible to recreate these extinct beasts by cloning them with DNA and tissue samples, which have been found, over the years, preserved in ice.",Science and Technology

Why do the world's most cerebral people find it so hard to convey their ideas? And how can we learn to do better? I suggest that answers can be found in a number of ideas from the modern sciences of mind and language. Among them are: The Tree and the Chain (how multidimensional ideas are mapped onto one-dimensional strings); The Curse of Knowledge (why it's so hard to imagine what it's like not to know something you do know); and Long Shadow of Mrs. Grundy (how to distinguish rules of proper usage that are worth keeping from those that are bogus)The first annual Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering lecture about communicating complex scientific and technological subjects clearly and engagingly in the series : Communicating Science and Technology in the 21st Century.Recorded on 9/12/12",Science and Technology

1064,ReVeUvwTGdU,3 years of Computer Science in 8 minutes,"This is the most asked question on my channel by far so I thought I'd explain how I learned programming. In the process I got a little distracted and accidentally explained all of computer science in 8 minutes (kind of). The goal of this video was to show you the connections between modern day (high-level) programming and how it was implemented at the low level. I show you the basics in Java and convert it to C code, then into Assembly, which leads me to talk about how computers perform addition/subtraction, and the logic design behind that is all implemented with transistors. In case you couldn't tell, I love low level programming. Just a disclaimer that I'm not saying this is the best way to learn programming I am simply sharing what I feel was the most valuable in my learning so far. I know many people start with web technologies which can be a great introduction as well! I am currently teaching myself a lot of server networking & all that stuff. I just believe if you really want to understand how to design algorithms and solve problems in creative ways then the most valuable things you can learn are at the low level. Even though C is 40 years old it is still regarded as producing the most efficient code since you have full control over pointers and memory management with minimal overhead. (the only thing faster is assembly.. an even lower level)Technical Resources!!C Programming Language, 2nd Edition (Awesome Book): https://amzn.to/2LDeFOrEasy68K (Assembly Simulator): http://www.easy68k.com/Hexadecimal to Binary Conversions: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/n...Two's Complement (Binary Addition/Subtraction): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s...Next Video:Previous Video:Social‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨Website: https://devoncrawford.ioTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevonCrawford13Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/devoncra...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/devoncrawfo...Github: https://github.com/devoncrawfordDiscord: https://discord.gg/sU2fur9Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/devoncrawfordGear‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨- Video Editing Software (Premiere Pro CC): https://goo.gl/rKx66D- All Adobe Apps (I use this plan): https://goo.gl/hrTYFS- Keyboard (Velocifire TKL01) : https://amzn.to/2AQTjJQ- Monitors (Dell U2518D) : https://amzn.to/2AQQmco- Webcam (Logitech C920): https://amzn.to/2Cw588c- Desk Microphone (Blue Yeti): https://amzn.to/2FPFmzi- DSLR (Canon T7i): https://amzn.to/2T54mpZ- Wide Lens (Tokina 11-16mm F2.8): https://amzn.to/2MlpvcO- Full list of gear: https://devoncrawford.io/gearMusic‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨emo the optimist - fading lightLink: https://soundcloud.com/emotheoptimist...shortfatty - distantLink: https://soundcloud.com/shortfatty/dis...a l e x - This WeekLink: https://beatsupply.fanlink.to/growing...Weaver Beats¬≤ - TRAPPIN IN Ôº®ÔºØÔºÆÔºØÔº¨ÔºµÔº¨Ôºµ‚Å¥Link: https://soundcloud.com/weaverbeats2/t...a l e x - Soul Will Mess With MeLink: https://beatsupply.fanlink.to/growing...a l e x - Peppy Won't Fly Straight and Its Getting on My NervesLink: https://beatsupply.fanlink.to/growing...",Science and Technology

1116,PPVY1BPYY2o,Postdoc's dorm room at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology),"This video shows the accommodation (provided at the rate of KRW 200,000 per month) to postdoctoral researchers whose marital status is single. This episode shows most of the amenities and furnishings in the private room. Be sure to watch the other video too, which shows surroundings outside of the private room. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=...)I made this video to show what it looks like because I was never told anything about the accommodation, other than that the university had signed me up for it without my explicit permission. I had no idea about its location, or what it looked like, or anything. This video attempts to give you an idea of what the provided accommodation looks like, including amenities and room furnishing. It should help you in your packing. Since I was told nothing, I did not know what to bring. I will explain the pro's and con's. (In fact, other than being told that the university had automatically signed up for housing, I was not given ANY detail about the accommodation until 2 days before my postdoc contract started. In fact, three days before my contract started, I had received an e-mail stating ""your accommodation hasn't been decided yet.  Tomorrow, the housing office wil let me know. So then i will give you the address."")There was a deposit amount of KRW 300,000.The video shows the content of the room. On the door is an electronic lock system. You can set a personal code to use to unlock the door. It is convenient because you never have to carry a key (other than the key card to get in and out of the building's main entrance). It is big enough to fit the provided furniture (bed, desk, orange chair, refrigerator, wash basin, large closet, small closet). It is not big enough to fit in anything else.At least the room is furnished, but you will have to provide your own bed sheets and pillow.There is not even enough room on the ground to fit in a spare mattress for an overnight visitor (and I suppose this partially explains why the building's policy is to have no overnight guests).What is not clear from this video is that this building (Male dormitory building 19) is in close proximity to other dorm buildings, including freshmen dorms. On any night of the week, at ANY hour, it is likely that very loud, rude, and drunk college students will walk between the buildings and wake you up.Overall, the provided accommodation is extremely bad and shameful for a first-rate university to provide as housing for its postdocs. Should you come here, at least you can use these videos to see what you will get. (The contract which you must sign, which you don't get to see before coming, stipulates that you'll live in the provided accommodation for at least 6 months.)What's also very interesting is that the four nearby high-rise GRADUATE STUDENT APARTMENTS are much nicer than these, with private kitchens, bathrooms, and several bedrooms.

They're are tons of stores, its easy to forget where you started and if you had been where you are already. Most stores will tell you a very ridiculous price at first you just have to tell them to make it what you would like to pay and maybe walk away and they will defiantly being it down. If you know any Chinese speak in Chinese and they won't tell you a crazy price because they think that you might live in china and you know better. They are a lot of stores with the same stuff, so before you buy something check it out in multiple stores so you know your getting the best one and the best price. They have some really cool stuff here, especially if you take your time a look through all the little stores you'll find some really cool stuff not just fake clothes or shoes. THANKS FOR WATCHING WATCH THIS: https://youtu.be/M8SI853d70gTips 1. Walk away if they won't bring down price and they will bring it lower immediately.2.

1147,4u3f7_p1i8c,Dr.John Hagelin: Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field,"John Hagelin (Ph.D. Quantum Physics) addresses the International Conference to Re-Establish Vedic India, 20 February, 2015 on Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field.Summary points: Vedic Science in Our Modern WorldVedic Science is scientific, practical, and indispensable in this modern age. The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation, smaller and smaller time and distance scales, from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels, culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter, culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life‚Äîthe field of transcendental existence, or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences, one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective, describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy, and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.Similarly, at every level of manifest creation, these two descriptions of nature‚Äôs functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles, the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.Moreover, this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well‚Äîthe self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly, superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field, which unfold sequentially to 24, 64, and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.This correspondence is intriguing, but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness, revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.The process of transcending‚Äîmoving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness, the Self (Atma)‚Äîprovides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.Yoga, at its deepest level, is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)‚Äîthe union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness, a ‚Äúwakeful hypo-metabolic state‚Äù of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest, which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging, measurable benefits for mental and physical health, as well as significant cost savings for health care.Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level, but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda, Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.Similarly, Vedic approaches to education, defense, and civilization as a whole are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, completely holistic and free from negative side effects. Thus the Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of ultimate reality‚Äîthe unified field.",Science and Technology

1164,H7UDLpaQtC4,UW Master of Science in Technology Innovation,"From smart homes to smart health, connected devices are transforming our daily lives and powering innovation across the globe. UW‚Äôs Master of Science in Technology Innovation teaches you how to design, develop and launch the connected solutions of the future. The MSTI is offered by the Global Innovation Exchange, a new partnership between the UW and Tsinghua University in China, with support from Microsoft. GIX brings students, faculty and industry professionals together to collaborate on solutions to global challenges such as sustainability and health care. Learn more at http://www.techinnovationdegree.uw.edu.Video Transcript:[Shwetak] What the MSTI, or the master‚Äôs of science and technology innovation degree, is all about is to really provide a broad understanding of what it means to innovate on a piece of technology. This includes the design aspect of it. How do you know that you're building the right thing and how you're building it right? But also prototyping. How do you know that the thing that you're trying to build is even feasible? So appreciating hardware and software development so that you know that this thing can even be built. And then pitching it, and then getting funding for it. So the entrepreneurial side of how do you launch a venture like this. And so the program is designed to integrate across all three of these different areas in an offering where a student can do it in one specific degree.[Linda] I think increasingly, in the pace of innovation and development in the technology fields, there's a growing expectation that any one person has a more rounded skillset, that has some of each of those in their skillset. And those are the professionals and the emerging students that are in more demand.The program is a 15-month program, so you would start in the fall, go the full four quarters and then a fifth quarter which is your launch phase.[Shwetak] So the first 12 months is you'll be iterating on a number of different projects, and you learn the, just the basics through these classes and tutorials.[Linda] Each quarter there's going to be a range of classes from some sort of very specific hands-on studios, something maybe as specific as a hardware-software lab or something about micro-controllers, to a design-thinking studio, which is going to be more processed based.[Shwetak] In the last three months of the 15-month period is what we call the launch phase. So you really settle on a particular project that you want to take it to the next level.It could be that you're working on a project that's sponsored by a corporation. It can be something where the student comes in and has their own idea, recruits students within the cohort to help them with their project that might get them to a point where they start to maybe spin out a company at the end of the program.[Linda] UW has a fantastic reputation for being the most innovative public university, which is wonderful. There's such a great embracing and support structure here at the University, and in Seattle more broadly, for innovation, for startups.[Shwetak] One of the things that's interesting about this program is not just the top faculty engaging with the students, but it's also the mentors and the, and the technologists and the thought leaders in the Pacific Northwest. This includes members of the venture capital community. It includes engineers and thought leaders at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing.[Linda] So there's a really, a coalescing of that energy, those services, that perspective, that experience in the community here from industry, that GIX will be able to tap into.[Shwetak] So the MSTI is housed within the Global Innovation Exchange.[Linda] GIX, Global Innovation Exchange, is a unique partnership between University of Washington, Tsinghua University and industry partners, most notably Microsoft. It encompasses a new type of interdisciplinary degree program that is much more team- and project-based, hands-on, to develop a closer partnership between industry partners and the educational experience and to really bring together kind of three different domains: technical innovation, an entrepreneurship lens and understanding of the business landscape.[Shwetak] And so we're looking at how do we engage the larger community? Not just the local community, but the global community, to create these really innovative graduate programs that allow students to solve these real-world problems and do it in such a way that's global in spirit.[Linda] So I'm really excited also about the facility that is being developed that will have maker space, and team spaces, studio facilities, you know, be state-of-the-art in terms of technology. It's really going to be a fantastic place for industry, faculty and students to come and work and engage and collaborate.[Shwetak] This program is really designed to teach people how to become innovators.",Science and Technology

1185,Z62eeT0bXuk,Future Technology - New Science BBC Documentary HD,"Technology (from Greek œÑŒ≠œáŒΩŒ∑, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±, -logia[3]) is the collection of techniques, methods or processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, etc. or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and factories, which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings of such things.The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.Watch more: https://goo.gl/5SCZ6z   *** *** *** *** *** ***************************************************Thanks for WatchingPlease Like and Subscribe to Watch more videos",Science and Technology
1186,pgX3JtwboEc,Shay Locomotive - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,"The Shay Geared Steam Locomotive, one of one hundred and sixteen known to remain worldwide (another five questionable and another six Willamette style Shays), was originally conceived by the American lumber merchant Ephraim Shay. The patent was sold to Lima Machine Works (eventually Locomotive Works Inc.) of Lima, Ohio who refined the concept and produced 2,768 Shays over a period of 67 years (1878-1945). The museum's Shay is composed of parts from two locomotives, one constructed in 1923, and the other in 1925. Both were constructed for the Merrill & Ring Lumber Co., Ltd and used in forestry operations at Theodosia Arm, British Columbia. The Shay was branded as the ""strong man of the woods"" because of its distinctive and unique mechanical workings, making it highly efficient in the logging industry. Immediately noticeable is the Shay's offset boiler to the left, positioned there in order to make room for the three cylinder engine mounted vertically on the right. The engine's pistons turn the crank shaft which is connected on both ends by universal and slip joints to the line shafts on the front and rear trucks. These transmit power to both axles on each truck by way of bevel gearing. Thus, all wheels are driven and produce tractive  or pulling  force of 22,580 pounds (10, 242 Kg), allowing the Shay to move along the steep grades of British Columbia's mountainous terrain while hauling substantial loads. With its flexible (pivoting and rotating) trucks, extra wide tires on each wheel and all axles powered design, the Shay Geared Steam Locomotive was able to negotiate the unrefined forestry railways that would easily stop or derail a conventional rod locomotive.",Science and Technology

1199,X5fhVLJs9go,William Johnson | Science and Technology of Metallic Glasses,"Metallic glasses are vitrified metal alloys ‚Äì liquid alloys that solidify without crystallizing. Like silicate glasses and thermoplastic polymers, they exhibit a glass transition below which the liquid freezes to a solid that resists shear on practical time scales. Bulk metallic glasses developed over the past two decades, exhibit unique thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties that make them an attractive choice for numerous engineering applications. Their glassy nature opens processing and manufacturing opportunities normally associated with plastics technology. The speaker will survey the scientific and technological evolution of metallic glasses from their inception to the present time. He will describe how metallic glass technology offers unique opportunities to change the way metals are used and commercial metal products are manufactured.William L. Johnson, the Ruben and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science at Caltech, joined the Caltech faculty in 1977. He received his B.A. in physics from Hamilton College and his Ph.D. in applied physics from Caltech. He spent two years at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center (1975-77) prior to joining the faculty at Caltech.Professor Johnson's research interests are centered on non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. His research advisor was Pol Duwez, the inventor of metallic glass. In the mid-1980's, he, along with Ricardo Schwarz, discovered solid-state amorphization, leading to many years of fruitful research. His research accomplishments include the first studies of superconductivity in metallic glasses, pioneering studies of crystal to glass transformations (see Progress in Materials Science, 30, 81-134 (1986)) and seminal work on the application of thermodynamics to ion beam induced modifications of materials (Nucl. Instr. & Methods, B7, 657 (1985)).This work was followed by the synthesis of nanocrystalline and amorphous materials by high energy ball milling, and, in 1993, the discovery of bulk metallic glasses. Professor Johnson has pioneered the discovery, characterization and science of bulk metallic glass forming alloys and their use as engineering materials (see, for example, Applied Phys. Letters, 63, 2342 (1993)). His recent work has involved the development of a theory that establishes fundamental physical principles governing flow in amorphous materials. His research group is continuing to discover new bulk metallic glass forming alloys employing both experimental methods and molecular dynamic simulations to predict potential glass-forming candidates.The discovery of new glass-forming alloys cascades into a chain of scientific investigations, including the measurement of thermal, mechanical, optical, electrical and viscous properties; fundamental research into the kinetics of crystallization and glass formation, and improving the properties of monolithic bulk metallic glass through the fabricaiton of intrinsically and extrinsically toughened composites.His research has lead to commercial success, too. He is an inventor on over 25 issued patents. He is a cofounder of Liquidmetal Technologies, in Lake Forrest California, which commercialized one of Professor Johnson's BMG alloys for golf club heads (under the company name ""LiquidMetal Golf""). The company is now pursuing opportunities in cases for electronic devices. They are also expanding into the defense industry, as some of the BMG composites have demonstrated properties superior to depleted uranium as high-velocity penetrators.Professor Johnson served on the editorial board of the Journal of Rapid Solidification, and serves currently as an associate editor for Journal of Applied Physics, and Applied Physics Letters. He is a principal editor of the MRS Journal of Material Science. He is author or co-author of over 230 publications in the scientific literature, and has contributed chapters to seven books. He has held numerous consulting positions for the Department of Energy, NASA, and corporations. Over the past two decades, he has been a consultant and on numerous advisory panels for the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Engineering.http://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/306...",Science and Technology

Open Science is a critical issueconsidered by the research community at large. The ongoing phenomenon of Open Science promotes on the one hand, transparent and frequent open-access updates of research progress; and other other hand, reproducible, accurate and verifiable research, bringing benefits for the individual researchers, the research community and the society. Like other fields, TEL research suffers from problems such as challenges to replicate, validity, publication bias, and high costs of access to publications. There are several initiatives that aim to change closed and nontransparent approaches to research. This Webinar will discuss the benefits, challenges, recommendations and best practices of Open Science in TEL.Malte Elson is an assistant professor and head of the Psychology ofHuman Technology Interaction group at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany where he studies human learning. His research interests are learning and problem solving processes in IT security, media effects and learning with media, and behavior research methods and meta science.

1211,ZX8kJfWzvX4,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),"Located in the science and research hub of Daedeok Innopolis in Daejeon, South Korea, the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed into an active institution, often placed among some leading universities in global scientific education and research.KAIST has connotations of academic excellence, innovation and entrepreneurship, but also the launch of large-scale projects. The university often ranks highly among other universities of a similar age.KAIST was established in February 1971 as Korea Advanced Institute of Science, with a loan given by United States Agency for International Development. The university aimed not only to educate young researchers in science and engineering, but also to provide a solid basis for the development of future higher education institutions in Korea.Its structure was created by an international team, which included the American electrical engineer and vice-president of Stanford University Frederick Emmons Terman. Unlike other public institutions in South Korea, KAIST has freedom to decide upon its entry requirements and course structure, which gives the university a special status.Today, KAIST has a rich academic portfolio in disciplines such as physics, mathematics, engineering, humanities and social sciences, business and management. The courses are delivered by 6 colleges and 2 schools, with over 33 divisions. KAIST‚Äôs unique institutes include the National NanoFab Center, which conducts research into nano-devices and their potential applications.KAIST consists of 2 major campuses situated in Daejeon and South Korea‚Äôs capital Seoul. They offer over 25 dormitories, 4 libraries and a medical centre. To ensure students are actively engaged in the campus cultural events, the university organises traditional opera and jazz recitals.Some of the most famous KAIST former faculty members and graduates are the electrical engineer Soon-dal Choi, mathematician Gi-hyong Gho and the physicist Chang Hee Nam.Subsribe on Happy Traveler - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7V...",Science and Technology

1223,RxmzCJug9HE,Science and Technology for Supporting Decisions in Natural Disasters | Bijan Khazai | TEDxKIT,"Disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods have devastating impacts on a community‚Äôs ability to thrive. Actionable decisions to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural disasters require a personalized understanding of risk. Most existing catastrophe risk assessment models consume huge amounts of time and data and are costly to use. They are commonly applied for assessment of high-value facilities, but numerous small and medium enterprises throughout disaster prone regions typically do not have the capacity and financial means to employ these modeling tools and services. Opening up risk models to a wider community and communicating risk outputs in a way that is useful to ordinary citizens and businesses can play a pivotal role in being better prepared for natural disasters.Dr. Bijan Khazai is a research scientist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology‚Äôs (KIT) Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM). He holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on developing GIS-based landslide hazard assessment models in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dr. Khazai‚Äôs research interests are social vulnerability analysis, megacity and urban risk, and information technology for post-disaster recovery planning. As a project specialist for Earthquake and Megacities Initiative (EMI), he has worked in a number of applied projects in Istanbul, Amman and Metro Manila and Mumbai.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.

1282,7oCbazJmU6I,Incredible UNSEEN FOOD in Sri Lanka - Indigenous Vedda Tribe!,"Dedicated to the amazing people of Sri Lanka. My heart and prayers go out to everyone affected in this tragedy. Sri Lanka remains one of my favorite countries in the world.Watch more Sri Lankan Food: https://youtu.be/4v9G2ArswUsRuzaina: https://www.instagram.com/theminority...Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every weekT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lSRI LANKAN FOOD - Sri Lanka is known As the pearl of the Indian Ocean, and that's because it really is a gem of an island. Today we had the privilege to visit an Indigenous Vedda Sri Lankan Village, where they prepared for us some traditional Sri Lankan food.We first arrived to the lake, where we then had to take a boat across the lake, and then walk for about 30 minutes to get the village. The lush greenery, and an actual beauty was pristine. It started raining, so we just stopped cup of tea.We arrived at the village, and we were greeted with open hands and an extremely warm welcom. The Aunty started cooking, a number of different dishes using millet, and the main dish with fresh deer meat. The food was unlike other Sri Lankan food I had before, and relied mainly on crops and ingredients they grew themselves locally.It was an honor to experience Vedda culture and tradition, and food. Even though Uncle and I could not speak the same language or communicate verbally, it was hugely rewarding to just sit next to Uncle, smile, and share thoughts and positivity.This was one of the most memorable meals and experiences I had in Sri Lanka.Special thanks to Ruzaina: https://www.instagram.com/theminority...

1285,0SZom2BLXNk,24 GENIUS FOOD HACKS THAT WORK MAGIC,"FOOD SECRETS YOU SHOULD KNOWIn this video, you will find a lot of surprising facts about food! Moreover, you will learn how food photographers make perfect photos of fast food to attract consumers. Have you ever noticed that burgers on photos look more attractive than in real life? Marketing specialists know that it‚Äôs very hard to make a perfect photo of a burger and have some tricks on how to do it. To make a well-proportioned photo of a burger, photographers secure layers with the help of toothpicks to make it bigger. In real life, everything spills out of a burger and looks really disappointing. The same problem with sandwiches and here photographers uses cardboard to keep cake layers dry and replace the sauce with shaving foam. Whipped cream is usually also replaced with shaving foam and toothpick is used to secure a cherry. When you buy French fries the look not so good as you see in the photo. Yes, there is a trick used to make perfect photos of fries. Kitchen sponge and toothpicks are used to secure fries. It‚Äôs really hard to make a photo of an ice-cream as it melts too fast. Instant mashed potatoes are usually used instead of ice-cream. Sounds crazy? Mashed potatoes are usually colored with food coloring. Moreover, photographers add aspirin to soft drinks to look them refreshing and fizzy. As a bonus, you will learn how to make fake caviar and use it to decorate dishes. You will need vegetable oil, sriracha, agar-agar. Pour water into a pan, add sriracha and agar-agar and stir these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water.TIMESTAMPS:00:09 Silver egg experiment01:20 Secrets of fast food photos02:13 Shaving foam instead of whipped cream06:20 Black ice-cream12:38 Onion lotus----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/Twitter: https://twitter.com/5m_craftsSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: https://goo.gl/fWbJqzSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: https://goo.gl/PEuLVtSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: http://bit.ly/2S69VUGThe Bright Side of Youtube: https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.meMusic by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/",Food

1298,1aRxeXGoM1o,35 SUPERB FOOD HACKS THAT WILL DEFINITELY SURPRISE YOU,"INCREDIBLE FOOD TRICKSDid you know that there are a lot of secrets about how to make food look irresistible on TV? Usually, burgers, fries, and ice-cream that we see in commercials look mouth-watering but reality never meets expectations. Food should look delicious so that you will want to eat it. In this video, we reveal some secrets of making perfect food photos and you will be shocked by the process of photo making. Sometimes it‚Äôs impossible to make a whole photo session of a product like it, for example, melts too fast as ice-cream does. That‚Äôs why the ice-cream, in fact, is replaced with instant mashed potatoes. Sounds crazy? Yes, but it‚Äôs the only way to make perfect ice-cream shots. Mash potatoes are colored with any color need. The same situation usually occurs when you need to photo cakes with whipped cream. Cream melts too fast and looks awful. So, photographers usually interlay cake layers with cardboard to keep them dry and replace cream with shaving cream. When you buy French fries, they look very disappointing. There is a whole technique on how to make French fries look attractive: kitchen sponge and toothpicks are used to secure fries for making a photo. Photographers add aspirin to soft drinks to look them refreshing and fizzy. Check out more kitchen ideas that will ease your life: make a pasta at home; add salt to the milk and it will last longer in the fridge; cover cheese with cheese wax and it will last longer, store cookies in a can with a piece of bread and it will be soft; place celery into the bag with bread to prevent the appearance of mold. Moreover, you will find a cool recipe of black ice-cream that you can make at home in 5 minutes!TIMESTAMPS:00:37 Homemade black ice cream01:14 White strawberry trick04:15 Always wash apples07:01 Secrets of food commercial15:56 How to store food and leftovers----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/Twitter: https://twitter.com/5m_craftsSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: https://goo.gl/fWbJqzSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: https://goo.gl/PEuLVtSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: http://bit.ly/2S69VUGThe Bright Side of Youtube: https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.meMusic by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/",Food

It's only cooked bone you should never feed your dogs - including those large Smoke Bones they sell at pet stores. Cooking the bone makes it undigested, brittle and prone to causing obstruction of the g-track and a perforated bowel. Canines are meant to digest raw bones and have been doing it for millions of years. Don't take my word for it though, I'm just some guy on YouTube... lol. Do your research. I'll provide some links down below if you'd like to do that.

Talatamaty City is home to one of the country‚Äôs largest local morning markets, Tsena‚Äôny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. ü•£RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. ü•°CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. ----2. TALATA VOLON‚ÄôONDRY: Sausage + KobaADDRESS: Talata Volon‚Äôondry OPEN: Varies Talata Volon‚Äôondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar‚Äôs national snack, koba. ü•îSAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. üá≤üá¨KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.üí∏PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -üí¨COME SAY HI:INSTAGRAM ¬ª http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)FACEBOOK ¬ª http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebooküíóSUPPORT OUR MISSION:Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:Mansion Tea StallThe thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plateNasi Lemak TanglinNasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plateIkan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everythingSri Ganapathi MessOne of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 peopleKedai Kopi Lai FoongFinally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong.

1346,qgHiyphqXRI,Chennai STREET Food Tour - Spinach Dosa + Mud Coffee + Egg Halwa,"So far our gastronomic quest across Chennai has been amazing. In this leg of the Chennai food tour we decided to join three of the super enthusiastic foodies and bloggers from the city to get a firsthand experience of what the locals have for snacks in the bustling streets of the city. We were ready for a different kind of spread that was far distanced from the staple street food offering.We were happy to start the journey with Irfan who was super jovial. Our first stop for the evening was Bharathi Mess at Mylapore where we tried the healthy spread of pearl millet, ragi or finger millet and spinach dosas with coconut and red chilli chutneys. Another dish that was worth trying was the Karuvepala Podi Idli. It was essentially stir fried idly tossed with lentil tempering, onion, spices and curry leaves powder ( Karuvepalai is the Tamil term for curry leaves powder). The delicious, tangy and spicy dish had a distinct flavour of ghee in it. The second stop was a bustling joint whose popular fares included home styled Karappu (sweet) Paniyaram and Pal Kozhukattai. The former is a fried stuff made up of rice and coconut batter while the later was thick mixture of tiny rice dumplings cooked in coconut milk and jaggery. Both the sweet dishes were authentic components of Tamil cuisine that are primarily prepared in household and are seldom found on streets. The taste was magical.Our third stop was Marina Beach which was full of cheerful crowd out for recreation. There was food all around and the variety was mind boggling. Here we tried an assortment of humble vegetable bhajjis or fritters from a stall. It was fresh and the taste was basic. The fourth stop there was a stall selling Nombu Kanji or a subtle, lightly spiced delicious porridge made up of rice, lentils, meat and tomatoes with a hint of fenugreek in it. It is a popular dish that the locals consume to break their fasts during Ramazan.Our fifth food halt was at a local stall selling Atho which is a Burmese styled hand tossed noodle salad that had cabbage and chicken in it. It tasted great along with the peppery soup that accompanied it. This Burmese influenced dish is quite popular in the area. We bid adieu to Irfan with a kulfi treat.The next host for the evening was Rivi who walked us through the exciting culinary experience at the Beseant Nagar beach. Here we tried a potpourri of yummy snacks which included the raw mango peanut Sundal, the fresh and crunchy Appalams , fried fish with the sprinkle of Tamil spices and the interesting Mud coffee. We specifically liked the fried fish which was spicy on the palate yet delicious and the crisp and subtle Appalams.Our last host of the evening was Sarath. We went on to try the Shawarma at a famous local joint where they served it like a sandwich instead of a roll. The deliciously cooked chicken was served between two flats breads with dollops of mayonnaise on it. It was indeed finger-lickingly yummy. The most surprising thing that Sarath made us try was the Naan and Butter Chicken at Charminar joint in Misharpet market which was available for just ten bucks. That sounded really fascinating to us. The very small portion of butter chicken gravy and a thin Naan made this deal possible. Taste wise it was average. Our final stop in this gastronomic street food sojourn was a Halwa shop at Royapettah. The Tamil Nadu Halwa House is a famous joint that has been catering to the sweet cravings of the locals with its hearty assortment of halwas. We tried two of its specialties; the Dum ka Roat halwa and the Ande ka halwa. The former was basic milk halwa that seemed to have a hint of crunch to it due to the sugar and reduced milk element in it, while the later didn‚Äôt taste like egg at all. We thank all our hosts for making the day so amazing.# chennaistreetfood #delhifoodwalksAbout the host - Anubhav Sapra: Anubhav Sapra is an avid foodie!

Chinese cooking is some of the best in the world, and in Chengdu, China, the cuisine is world famously known as Sichuan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine. It is spicy and numbing and covered in delicious Chili oil. I moved here to Chengdu specifically to be able to eat spicy and delicious Chinese street foods. ‚ñ∫For addresses a full Chengdu Food Tour, visit my blog post on Chengdu street food, it has a huge list of the best street foods to try in Chengdu, China. The Chengdu food guide features all of the locations within this Chinese street food video: ‚ñ∫https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ult...In this Chinese street food tour video, we're starting out with one of China's most famous foods; DUMPLINGS. In Chengdu, they are different from the rest of China. Here, they are boiled and covered in a thick and spicy chili oil that leaves you so SATISFIED! These are some of the most satisfying dumplings ever! I must admit though, the filling could have been more plump. If you are traveling to Chengdu to eat Szechuan cuisine, I would personally recommend trying the red chili oil wontons first. And after those amazing dumplings in Chengdu, we're eating another famous dish in Sichuan cuisine, RABBIT. Eating rabbit is very famous in Sichuan, and here in Chengdu, locals love it in a numbing and spicy Szechuan Sauce. But we wanted to try a more UNIQUE style of eating rabbit in Sichuan, on top of noodles. So we visited a local rabbit noodle joint and ate a couple unique bowls of Chinese Sichuan noodles. The first was the rabbit noodles, where the rabbit is served to you in thin slices covered in chilies, ginger, and onions. You then pour it over top of your thick and spicy chili oil broth noodle bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The next bowl of spicy noodles that we ordered was the beef noodle soup - red braised beef noodle soup. Super delicious and spicy!After eating those 2 bowls of delicious Sichuan noodles, we are bringing you to a nice original fly restaurant of Chengdu, Mingting fandian. The fly restaurants of Chengdu are old locations that are sometimes less than cleanly but have incredible food! Nowadays most fly restaurants in Chengdu are actually really clean and you don't have to worry about getting sick from eating the street food. At mingting restaurant, we ordered a river carp,  spicy pork blood, spare ribs, fried sticky rice strips, Sichuan sausages, twice cooked pork, and pig brain tofu. It was all incredibly delicious!And for our final meal in this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're going for one of the most famous foods to try in Sichuan, HOT POT! We found a local 9 section hot pot that serves spicy and delicious hot pot and is always busy!

1364,bfwgVVTc40Q,10 Foods to Avoid to Get the Flat Belly You've Dreamed Of,"We all want to have a flat stomach, but even with intensive workouts and dieting belly fat remains the most difficult kind to get rid of. The secret that will help you drop some pounds is avoiding certain foods.  You most likely know it already, but it won‚Äôt hurt going over it again: avoid junk food, fried foods, and ice cream. The more you get, the more you want to satisfy your ever-growing craving. If you‚Äôre seriously set on getting rid of belly fat, you really do have to kick the habit of drinking pop and store-bought juices. Even diet soda slows down your metabolism and makes your body store more fat. Speaking of drinks, you‚Äôll also have to say no to alcohol. Some alcoholic beverages are loaded with calories, but it‚Äôs not just about the caloric content in certain drinks. Alcohol consumption itself increases your appetite and confuses the part of your brain that‚Äôs responsible for that full feeling in your stomach.Along with sugar, salt should also be limited to small amounts, especially if you suffer from high blood pressure. Remember that one tablespoon of mayonnaise has about 100 calories.Another food to avoid is chewing gum. When you chew gum, your brain and stomach get signals that prepare them for an incoming meal. This means that gum triggers the overproduction of stomach acid, which ends up making you feel hungry.Music: In Every Way  is licensed under a Creative Commons license(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)Artist: Freedom Trail Studio https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx6k...TIMESTAMPSAlcoholic drinks 0:38Soda 1:41Chewing gum 2:50Foods high in sodium 3:26Fast food 4:12Mayonnaise 5:08Fried foods 5:37Ice cream 6:14Foods that make you bloat 7:14‚ÄúSugar-free‚Äù foods 8:23SUMMARY-Alcohol consumption itself makes you feel hungry, so no matter how full you are, when you go for a bottle of beer, you usually grab a snack too.-If you‚Äôre seriously set on getting rid of belly fat, you really do have to kick the habit of drinking pop and store-bought juices. -Gum triggers the overproduction of stomach acid, which ends up making you feel hungry, especially for sugary stuff. -Not only are high-sodium foods harmful to your health, they also make your body retain fluids, resulting in a puffy belly.-Junk food is a scary mix of fat, sugar, and chemical additives that give it a great taste negatively affect the good bacteria in your gut, and that leads to obesity.-If you‚Äôre a big fan of mayonnaise, then you should know that this condiment contains at least 80% fat.-Foods fried in oil work like a sponge that absorbs saturated fats that trick your brain and so you just keep shoving food in your mouth without even noticing it.-The more ice cream you get, the more you want to satisfy your ever-growing craving.-Dairy, apples, lentils, beans, and artichokes all cause bloating which gives bulging bellies to even the skinniest people. -Artificial sweeteners in ‚Äúdiet‚Äù foods might have no calories in them, but they will make you want to eat more, which only leads to gaining excess weight.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",Food

1387,amCyI5JBRoc,7 DAY WATER FAST - NO FOOD FOR A WEEK (Before & After),"DISCLAIMER: We are not doctors, nor experts on fasting. We do not recommend anyone do a medically unsupervised water fast. If we had not been in Northern Spain when Lou got injured, he would have gone to True North Health Center (https://www.healthpromoting.com/) in California to do his water fast with the support of their medical team. If you are under 18 years old, on medication, addicted to any substances, have currently or had a history of eating disorders, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have heart problems or any other diseases it is even more important that you seek the advice of a medical professional before attempting a water fast on your own. It might sound really crazy to you, but Lou did a 7 DAY WATER FAST! If you've never heard of a water fast, it is very simple: don't eat any food or drink anything other than pure filtered water for a specified amount of time, so for Lou that was one entire week without any food, no coffee, no tea, no lemon water, no juice, or vitamins - just plain filtered water and rest. You might be familiar with the trendy diet called Intermittent Fasting. Here people only eat in a certain window of time (16 hr fast/9 hr feed or 14 hr fast/10 hr feed) and while this has lots of touted health benefits, Lou was in need of relief fast from a horrible back injury and decided he'd do whatever he could to get results quickly as possible. One of the main benefits of fasting is the body's ability to reduce inflammation. Instead of spending lots of energy digesting food, the body can now work to rebuild the immune system and while there still aren't many long term trials of fasting's effects on humans, science is showing that fasting can be used to help treat a whole host of problems like heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases. Over 6 years ago Lou was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the joints, and over the course of the last few years has been able to get off medication and manage his symptoms with the help of a low-fat oil free plant based vegan diet. However, when he does stray from a health-promoting diet his RA symptoms do begin to resurface. So while we're not sure if his back injury had to do with his RA, either way, the autoimmune disease makes his healing process extremely slow. We live in a van, so being immobile was actually a very scary experience, and left Lou to embark on this water fasting journey.  The before and after is astounding as his pain levels went from an 8 out of 10 to... well you have to watch for that! Before we get to the video, I just wanted to say that a lot of people come to water fasting searching for a quick fix for weight loss and I really recommend that you reconsider. Water fasting is a wonderful tool to manage health conditions with the help of doctor supervision, but when it comes to weight loss it might not be your most effective tool because if post fast you continue all the same habits you will be left in the same position. If you are searching for weight loss please research a low-fat plant-based diet, but mainly I want you to really think about where the desire to lose weight is coming from. Our society tells us constantly that we are not good enough and instead of buying into this lie, this might be the time you instead embrace yourself as you are. Focus on self-love, body-acceptance, and finding self-worth outside of ascetics. Diet culture is toxic, and while I know it's complicated for me to write about it as we are huge advocates for a low-fat vegan diet as its been an incredible tool to manage Lou's autoimmune disease, in the end, I want people to know that they are worthy as is. No crazy lifestyle changes will change your relationship to yourself unless you do the mental work. Thanks for being here with us and while I know water fasting might make a lot of people uncomfortable it was an incredible experience for Lou and I hope you can see how much it helped him.For more information please check out my blog post on Lou's 7 Day Water Fast Experience: https://www.wildweroam.com/blog/7dayw...#waterfast #7daywaterfast #nofoodforaweek................Our newsletter:http://eepurl.com/disTjT.................MUSIC30 Day Free Trial for Epidemic Sound - http://share.epidemicsound.com/pl2WQ ........................................................Camera Gear*Video Camera: Canon EOS-1DX Mark II - https://amzn.to/2G9NskWMain Lens: Canon 24-105 f4 - http://amzn.to/2D1SA70Full gear list - https://www.wildweroam.com/gear........................................................Keep in Touch: on http://instagram.com/wildweroam* The gear section includes Amazon affiliate links.

1388,tUn50ml4e_0,Top Foods That Bloat You (Stomach and Face Bloating),"Click Here to Subscribe: http://Bit.ly/ThomasVidWebsite: http://ThomasDeLauer.com20% Off my Keto Collagen Protein: http://www.perfectketo.com/thomas-del...Top Foods That Bloat You (Stomach and Face Bloating)Facial BloatingFacial bloating is most prominent in the morning upon waking up (cause you‚Äôve been lying down ‚Üí gravity), however, it can continue throughout the dayCause - Dehydration Dehydration - SleepMany people incorrectly assume that high water consumption leads to bloating - In reality, dehydration results in fluid retention, particularly in the face (sleeping results in mild dehydration)It makes urine output decrease and instead of processing liquid out of the body, the water is reabsorbed into the tissue. When this occurs, swelling, and possibly pain, will resultIn other words, dehydration causes a buildup of fluid in the tissues and causes blood vessels to enlarge, which gives the face a ‚Äúpuffy‚Äù look Dehydration - SodiumHigh sodium intake is the number one culprit for fluid retention - the typical american diet is plagued with excessive sodium levelsThe job of the kidneys is to filter the excess sodium into the urine so that the body can get rid of it - Sodium attracts water to it and is known as being osmotic. Water follows the sodium and is drawn into the bloodstream. Excessive salt keeps the circulatory volume higher than it should be, creating and increased pressure in the blood stream and pressing on the blood vessel walls  (5)One way to flush sodium out of the body is by getting more potassium - We average 2,500 mg a day, about half of the 4,700 mg minimum recommended for adultsPotassium blunts the effects of sodium by helping relax the walls of blood vessels - The more potassium we eat, the more sodium we pass out of the body through urine. Cream of Tartar: Cream of tartar, also called potassium hydrogen tartrate, provides a bioavailable form of potassium rather than taking a potassium supplement One teaspoon of cream of tartar = 495 mg of potassiumNote: Most people don‚Äôt realize that fresh and frozen poultry is sometimes injected with a sodium solution - so check the labelStomach Bloating Stomach bloating is the result of gas or fluid accumulating in your GI tract, or when bacteria in your large intestine have a hard time breaking down certain foods The most common type of foods that cause stomach bloating are high FODMAP foods. FODMAP is an acronym that stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols Since your body is unable to completely digest these sugar molecules, they travel through your GI tract and reach your colon undigested, where the bacteria that live in your colon begin to ferment them. The fermentation can produce gas and bloatingRaw Cruciferous Vegetables (Kale, Broccoli, Cabbage) Cruciferous veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, etc.) cause bloating and gas when eaten in their raw form - extremely high in insoluble fiber, which can be difficult for your body to break down. Cooking vegetables helps break down the fibers they contain, which makes them easier on the digestive system because they‚Äôre already partly broken down. Cruciferous veggies also contain raffinose, a sugar molecule - Raffinose cannot be broken down in the small intestine as humans lack the alpha-galactosidase enzyme required to break it down. It passes through your GI tract completely undigested. Once it reaches the large intestine though, the bacteria there thrive on it and ferment raffinose into large volumes of hydrogen, methane and other gases. Fermented Veggies: Sauerkraut, kim chi, sauerruben and curtido are excellent alternatives for people with gut issues. First, the fermentation process ‚Äúpre-digests‚Äù the vegetables and makes them easier to absorb. Second, fermented veggies contain probiotic microorganisms that help heal the gutReferences1) Bloating and functional gastro-intestinal disorders: where are we and where are we going? - PubMed - NCBI.

1391,Qa0lNfaU4Bc,"Haarlem, Netherlands weekly outdoor food market","It's Saturday morning in the Dutch city of Haarlem, Netherlands and the open market is in full bloom. It's one of the larger and more lively market squares in all of Holland.  Market day in a European city is generally a lot of fun. You get a chance to mingle around with the locals then have a look at the produce, and the cheese and the fruits and different clothing items for sale, participating like a resident ‚Äì and maybe you'll find something good to eat.It's no surprise this big event is at the central market square right in the middle of town next to the big church.When traveling it's not always easy to strike up conversations with the locals but on market day everybody is ready to talk, so by all means have some chats with the vendors.If you don't find anything to eat at the market there are a number of caf√©s all around the market. There's a beautiful corner bar here ‚Äì people kicking back watching the parade of people going by, having a drink or having a meal. It's a perfect spot for a break before plunging back into the market.The buildings all around the market square are beautiful and historic. Most of them date back to the 1600s. You've got the old meat market, you've got the weighing house, the City Hall, and the big church, the Grote Kerk, there is an archaeology museum and some former residences of the nobles.Well you can see how much fun this market is but you've got to be here on a Saturday to catch all of this action. So if you can possibly arrange your schedule, if you're staying in Amsterdam and you're around on a weekend, by all means come on over to Haarlem and have a walk around the market and then see the rest of town.We have more movies about Haarlem so be sure to have a look at our YouTube channel and subscribe so you can be notified about all of our recent uploads.

He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.Price - 6 AED ($1.63) eachMachboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!MUSIC:***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8hMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zGorillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkII would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Check out Peyman‚Äôs channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...",Food

1395,L4KRCY3h4gA,Top 12 Super Foods That Fight Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is a disease caused by our bodies cellular unbalance. It‚Äôs most commonly found in women.Early diagnosis is the best way to effectively treat breast cancer, so getting an annual mammogram is one of the best ways for women over 40 to prevent this disease.Aside from early diagnosis, keeping your cells balanced and free of harmful free radicals is the second best way to avoid this disease.So, here is a list of foods that contain chemical compounds that help slow the development of cancer.Green TeaGreen tea is rich in polyphenols and catechins. These substances are antioxidants that protect our cells from DNA damage caused by free radicals. One cup of green tea per day is the recommended amount.Pomegranate juicePomegranate juice also contains polyphenols. According to recent studies, pomegranate juice has the potential to be a preventative tool for certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. Blueberries, strawberries and black raspberriesThese fruits contain large quantities of polyphenols, that may contain anticancer properties. Furthermore, they are rich in antioxidants, such as vitamin C. You should eat from ¬æ of a cup to 1 cup of fruit a day. Plums and peachesStudies indicate that the polyphenols found in plums and peaches can help prevent breast cancer cell formation and keep them from multiplying. Evidence suggest that polyphenols help kill cancerous cells, without harming healthy cells.Cruciferous vegetablesThese vegetables are normally rich in antioxidants (such as vitamins C, E and K) and fiber. The most popular cruciferous vegetables are:- Broccoli;- Cauliflower;- Brussel sprouts;- Arugula;- Cabbage. Green vegetablesThe greener the vegetable, the denser the nutrients. Green vegetables are normally rich in antioxidants and fibers, which makes them valuable tools against cancer.CarotenoidsCarotenoids are found in red, orange, dark green and yellow fruits and vegetables. These foods are very rich in vitamin A, lutein, beta carotene and lycopene, all of which are effective against free radicals. ApigeninApigenin is a flavonoid found in certain fruits, vegetables and herbs. As apigenin is an antioxidant, these foods may have anti-inflammatory properties as well.The most common sources of apignenin are:- Parsley; - Celery; - Chamomile; - Mint; - Spinach; - Licorice. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Found abundantly in cold water fish, omega-3 fatty acids are an essential nutrient for the functioning of your immune system.The most common sources of Omega-3 are:- Salmon; - Sardines; - Herring; - Fish oils, such as cod liver oil. Whole grainsWhole foods also tend to be high in anticancer polyphenols, they usually include other essential nutrients such as fiber, magnesium and protein.Some examples of whole grains are:- Brown rice;- Oats;- Corn;- Barley. Peppers Both dehydrated and fresh peppers contain capsaicin. This component is a very powerful antioxidant in the fight against free radicals and it also has anticancer power. The hotter the pepper, the higher the concentration of capsaicin.GarlicGarlic is especially effective for people suffering from breast cancer that have a reaction with estrogen. SaffronSaffron has curcumin that helps decrease the toxic effects of certain breast cancer cells and can inhibit the growth of cancer cells.Always remember that breast cancer treatment should be overseen by a doctor, however, these tips may help to complement it, so talk to your doctor about these foods.Disclaimer: The materials and the information contained on Natural Cures channel are provided for general and educational purposes only and do not constitute any legal, medical or other professional advice on any subject matter.

Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN‚Äôs 2011 list of the World‚Äôs 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store.

Subscribe For New Videos! http://goo.gl/UIzLeBWatch our ""Most MYSTERIOUS Lost Worlds On Earth!"" video here: https://youtu.be/oX1rLjFYseAWatch our ""Most CREEPY Things Found Frozen In Ice!"" video here: https://youtu.be/HaiYn6wpTPQWatch our ""Most SCARY Mythical Creatures Ever!"" video here: https://youtu.be/LEvBTkPo2R4#10 Prime MeatThe prime cut meats that smaller restaurants and corporations sell are one of the biggest complaints that high-end chefs and physicians make. That‚Äôs because ‚Äòprime cut‚Äô suggests that it is a single cut of the best meat from the animal.But this isn‚Äôt the case in many restaurants. Actually, what if I told you they chop up all the leftover meat and glue it back together? Does the word transglutaminase ring a bell? This is the name for the meat glue they use to glue the low quality meat back together to make you think you‚Äôre getting a full piece. This is more than a lie, this is disgusting. Besides the fact that it is using the worst tiny cuts of meat, it‚Äôs made from ammonia. The stuff used in fertilizers and oven cleaners. They try to fight back by claiming it kills E Coli, which should not be something we should be worried about being on meat anyway. Justifying making people unknowingly eat ammonia just so they can pass off scrap meat does not seem ethical in the least. Be very careful where you eat your steak! See, this is why being a vegetarian seems like a safer option! Or maybe seafood‚Ä¶.#9 Imitation CrabOr maybe not seafood. For one, crustaceans feed off the worst possible debris on the bottom of the ocean. The only nastier creature is shrimp. This stuff they eat doesn‚Äôt magically disappear when they are caught and cooked either. There‚Äôs still‚Ä¶stuff in it that we eat‚Ä¶secondhand.Nevertheless, it‚Äôs expensive to buy fresh crab and shrimp, but you can get crab cakes and other delicacies at the grocery store for a pretty good price. Why? It‚Äôs usually because it is fake, under the guise of imitation crab meat.Imitation crab meat is made from the remains of other fish that are mushed together, and injected into a mold. They mince and mince random fish, whatever they can get their hands on, until it turns into the same texture as crab. It is then created into a paste that is frozen and then shaved into crab-like flakes. To make it taste like crab, they just add flavor and paint it to look like crab. So, next time you go for some cheap crab, remember that‚Äôs probably, beaten, frozen, shaved, and painted fish remains. I kind of like imitation crab but not really a fan of this process...it still tastes good so if you‚Äôre okay with this‚Ä¶then go ahead. #8 Parmesan CheeseParmesan cheese is delicious! Especially, real authentic parmesan cheese. But did you know that companies will usually lie about what‚Äôs in ‚Äúparmesan‚Äù?The FDA regulations make it legal to sell fake Parmesan cheese. This is some scary stuff. There are two huge deal breakers with parmesan. One is grated parmesan in the shaker. Most of the time, cellulose and mold inhibitor chemicals are added so it won‚Äôt clump. Cellulose, not cellulite, that‚Äôs just an after effect. Cellulose comes from ground up wood pulp and is considered ‚Äúharmless and organic matter‚Äù. They usually add 2-4% cellulose, but the FDA doesn‚Äôt restrict it. In fact, some has been proven to carry 20%! That‚Äôs a lot of cellulose on your pasta! The saddest part is, this is just allowed in the United States. Parmesan cheese legally means the kind of cheese that comes from Parma, Italy. But in the US, you can call it parmesan when it‚Äôs just dehydrated, grated mozzarella.This is like the Kobe beef of cheeses. Most of the time, when you get parmesan, it‚Äôs not parmesan. It‚Äôs cellulose and a mixture of cheap cheeses.#7 Egg SubstituteThis one is a little different. No one knows what it is, but many believe that it‚Äôs a great substitute for people with egg allergies. But really, it‚Äôs still just eggs. They take mostly egg whites, fresh, frozen, or powdered, and add other ingredients. But not much. They actually just contain 99% egg whites! There‚Äôs not actually much substituting going on. It might be easier for people who don‚Äôt want to go to the trouble dealing with egg shells and yolks slipping everywhere, etc. In reality, it is called egg substitute because of that 1% that‚Äôs just artificial coloring,  salt, onion powder, and who knows what else. Why? Why would they just flavor egg whites? ‚ÄúEgg substitute‚Äù is kind of misleading and should be for people with egg allergies who need a substitute. It shouldn‚Äôt just be eggs. Maybe it‚Äôs substituting something else? Is it the bottle substituting for the shell? Bottom line is‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt egg substitute, it‚Äôs just expensive eggs.",Food

1404,CgPXS7K0hJ4,"These 8 ""Healthy"" Foods are Making You Fat!","Get ripped in 90 days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workoutsSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMWEating healthy is a requirement if you want to get ripped and lose body fat fast.  The problem is, often times foods masquerade themselves as healthy when they are anything but.  In this video, I show you how to spot the 8 biggest healthy foods making you fat.  We call these trap foods because they sneak up on you when you least expect it.I don‚Äôt care how much you are training or working out, if you refuse to get your nutrition in check you will never look as lean as you should or could.  Proper nutrition and good food choices are required to get ripped.  What I hate however is when you are misled into thinking that certain foods should be in your diet because they are ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù.  You blindly trust the guidance and then wind up frustrated when you aren‚Äôt seeing the results for your efforts.  In order to fix this once and for all, you simply have to educate yourself about these traps so you can avoid them in favor of better choices.First up is guacamole.  Recently, I did a video on how the healthy fats in avocado are great for your body.  The problem is, people confuse healthy foods for lean foods.  Packing a huge calorie wallop with every tablespoon, we tend to overlook the impact eating this food can quickly have on our waistline by eating almost 10-12 tablespoons per serving on average.  Sure, healthy fats are healthy, but like anything else‚Ä¶eaten in excess you will quickly run into trouble with them.Low fat or lite versions of foods are often way worse than the full fat, regular versions.  Beyond the fact that they usually just do a sugar for fat swap, you‚Äôre also getting a bunch of chemicals thrown in to these highly processed foods that you probably want to avoid all together.Now I know a lot of people like to have their morning glass of OJ or other fruit juice, but if you are looking to get ripped then you are far better off opting for water and getting your fruit in solid form.  The amount of sugars packed into these ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù drinks is astounding.  In fact, you are likely to find that a comparison between them and a glass of soda yield almost the same amount.  Add in the fact that liquid calories are far too easy to consume (and don‚Äôt provide the fiber benefits of the solid forms) and you‚Äôve got another reason to avoid these.Sushi is supposed to be a healthy food option that packs a protein punch in the process.  Not so fast.  In fact, with just a sliver of fish in every piece, you‚Äôre getting just 15% protein and instead packing in the starchy carbs with enough sticky rice to hold a small fort together!  Add in the sodium IV drip you‚Äôre getting from your ‚Äúlow sodium‚Äù soy sauce and you‚Äôve just made another perfect trap food.  Opt for the sashimi instead and you‚Äôll get what you thought you were getting when you iniitally decided on having sushi.There‚Äôs something about the word granola that just sounds so healthy.  Maybe it‚Äôs that it sounds like the word grain?  Whatever the case, you can‚Äôt ignore the fact that this is made up of calorically dense ingredients that just won‚Äôt play well in an attempt to lose fat.  If you don‚Äôt make it yourself then you‚Äôre going to be guaranteeing yourself a ton of sugar and syrup as well, as both are needed to hold all of this ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù together.There are more trap foods not covered here in the description but you will find in this video.  You want to be sure if you are not avoiding them all together that you are at least educated about their pitfalls so you can limit them in your diet when you are trying to get and stay lean.

1408,DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it‚Äôs not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. Even if you see the juice labels ‚Äúnot from concentrate‚Äù or ‚Äú100% pure‚Äù, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it‚Äôs pink, purple, or red, it‚Äôs most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.Music: Vibe Mountain - Great HopeThe 126ers - Reversed EclipseRondo Brothers - Yellow GoldKevin MacLeod - Jay JaySilent Partner - Pink Lemonadehttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...TIMESTAMPSFruit juices 0:37Energy bars 1:42Cereal 2:31Margarine 3:21Low-fat yogurt 4:11Ice cream 5:01Eggs 6:07Microwave popcorn 7:09Sugar-free candy 8:32Diet soda 9:26SUMMARY-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. -Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils‚Äô trans-fat content.-Manufacturers load ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.-Microwave popcorn‚Äôs almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.-If candy doesn‚Äôt contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",Food

1423,bnZaVRNBIFU,Swedish Food in Stockholm: Melt-In-Your-Mouth Dill Cured Salmon!,"‚ñ∫Check out my Stockholm travel guide for food lovers: https://goo.gl/Duc1fB‚ñ∫Subscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe‚ñ∫Camera I use: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hvDay 18: Stockholm, Sweden - This was a Stockholm food tour day. We started by visiting a couple of well known Swedish food halls, and then ate some more delicious Swedish food. It was an amazing day of visiting Stockholm!00:25 Swedish breakfast at Courtyard Marriott - The Courtyard Marriott hotel in Stockholm had an impressive display of breakfast foods including plenty of Swedish food in the buffet as well. So we started off the day with breakfast at our hotel before starting off.5:03 H√∂torgshallen Food Hall - After walking around Stockholm for a while and fully enjoying the views of the city and the water, we made our way over to H√∂torgshallen Food Hall, one of the Swedish food destinations on this Stockholm food tour day. After contemplating what to eat for a while, I settled on eating at a place called Melanders Fisk that specializes in seafood. Ying had the poached salmon and I had a the dill cured salmon (gravad lax). It was impressively good, the salmon was melt in your mouth tender and it was served with a side of potatoes as well. I also had toast skagen which are shrimp over toast. It‚Äôs one of my favorite Swedish foods. Total price - 370 SEK ($43.32)12:32 √ñstermalmshallen Food Hall - Another legendary food hall in Stockholm is the gourmet √ñstermalmshallen Food Hall. It‚Äôs been around since 1888, but they‚Äôve been doing renovation on the original market for the last couple years, so it‚Äôs a temporary market for now. The market has a lot of similar restaurants and gourmet food stalls as H√∂torgshallen, and there‚Äôs no shortage of amazing looking food. After walking around for a while, since we had just eaten, I chose to buy some moose sausage, which was pretty good.15:49 √ñstermalms Korvspecialist - Next stop on this Stockholm food tour is √ñstermalms Korvspecialist which is just a short walk from √ñstermalmshallen Food Hall and they specializes in marevelous sausages. I ordered the kabanoss, a spicy sausage filled into a baguette and seasoned with mustard and sauerkraut. It was a truly delicious sausage, I loved it. Kabanoss - 60 SEK ($7.02)18:36 Gamla Stan - Gamla Stan is Old Stockholm and it‚Äôs filled with narrow medieval lanes, shops and restaurants, and it‚Äôs just a great place to walk around and explore. We stopped at the German Church and I just enjoyed the atmosphere and just walking around on foot.21:44 Nystekt Str√∂mming - When I asked you where to eat in Stockholm, one of the top places I was recommended over and over was Nystekt Str√∂mming, a food stall that specializes in serving Baltic herries. They serve fresh herring, not the notorious Swedish fermented herring. I ordered str√∂mming on rye which came with deep fried herring, mustard, onions, and dill on top. It was awesomely delicious. By this time on this Stockholm food tour day I was getting pretty full. Str√∂mming - 40 SEK ($4.68)So we ended the day here. It was a wonderful day in Stockholm eating lots of delicious food!Disclaimer and Thank You: Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...) for sponsoring my business class flights.

1430,pBPXxO9E-fQ,West African Food - EXOTIC DELICACY in GHANA!,"‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Bushmeat is a term that is used to often describe wild game meat in Africa. And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It‚Äôs a delicacy!So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender.

1434,_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,"How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It‚Äôs definitely something worth knowing if you‚Äôre struggling with excess weight.  The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called blood glucose. If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.TIMESTAMPS: What glycemic index is 0:58Foods that digest slowly 3:30Foods that digest moderately 4:08Foods that digest quickly 4:34 Foods that don‚Äôt have a glycemic index value 5:27What about pizza? 6:09 Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 6:43Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/SUMMARY: - The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman‚Äôs terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.- If you eat something that‚Äôs high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.- There are also foods that really don‚Äôt really have a glycemic index value since they don‚Äôt contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.- If you‚Äôre having pizza that‚Äôs just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they‚Äôre processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",Food

1438,TKyY5zhrlfQ,15 Foods That Reduce Your Heart Attack Risk by 80%,"Do you want to clean your blood vessels? How to decrease the risk of heart attacks in the future? Are you ready to improve your overall well-being? Here are 15 food products that can take care of your heart and prevent heart diseases. Our heart is one of the most important organs, but, surprisingly, we take care of it the least, loading it every day with stress and unhealthy diets. And that's too bad because fatty food increases cholesterol levels, which leads to vascular plaques that prevent the heart from working correctly. In this video, you will get familiar with 15 products that perform all these activities! Some of them might surprise you with their health benefits!Watch till the end - as a bonus, you will find a recipe for a special drink for healthy blood vessels. And remember to press the like button in appreciation of our work!TIMESTAMPSFatty fish 1:05Oatmeal 1:51Berries 2:30Dark chocolate 3:19Nuts 4:00Extra virgin olive oil 4:45Red wine 5:23Green tea 5:53Broccoli and spinach 6:35Avocado 7:39Pomegranate 8:13Cinnamon 8:43Watermelon 9:14Garlic 9:43Apples and pears 10:28SUMMARY- Salmon, mackerel, herring, haddock, and other fatty fish decrease the risk of arrhythmia and atherosclerosis. They also contain lots of vitamins as well as minerals. - Rich in fiber, porridge decreases the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol and improves digestion. Coarse oatmeal is the healthiest. - Blueberries and strawberries are very good at lowering blood pressure and dilating blood vessels. Strawberry-lovers also get fiber, folate, antioxidants, and potassium from their favorite berries. - Dark chocolate provides the anti-stress effect as it increases the production of serotonin which is known for its calming effect. Cocoa, the main component of dark chocolate, also helps to prevent memory decline. - Nuts contain protein fibers that are useful for the heart. They also have vitamin E as their ingredient which helps to decrease the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol. - Olive oil is very high in oleic acid which reduces blood pressure. It is interesting that when the olives are crashed, oil leaves them naturally; therefore, beneficial ingredients and vitamins are not harmed by chemicals or preservatives. - French scientists have also found out that red wine contains some elements which can prolong a human lifespan for about 60 percent! Saying this, it still should be consumed in moderation. - Green tea makes the brain function better. This drink may decrease the risk of different types of cancer (such as prostate and breast cancer).- Broccoli, in particular, has a lot of medicinal benefits, such as prevention of some kinds of cancer, digestive system improvement, detoxification of the body. It also resembles a vitamin injection, filling you with numerous vitamins and minerals. - Avocados are packed with fiber, which can be useful for weight loss, blood sugar reduction, and other health-benefitting processes. - Pomegranates contain antioxidants, lower blood pressure, normalize blood circulation and increase hemoglobin levels. - Cinnamon can protect you from heart diseases and atherosclerosis. It also boosts metabolism and helps you to lose weight. - Watermelon plays an important role in vascular health. It stabilizes the cholesterol levels and contains antioxidants. It provides hydration, which is a great thing for your body. - Garlic dilates the vessels, lowers blood pressure, alleviates vasoconstriction, and prevents atherosclerotic plaques from appearing. It improves digestion as well, assisting in the functioning of the intestines. - Apples and pears are rich in fiber that helps your heart. They normalize blood circulation and are cheaper and more readily available alternatives to pomegranates. Besides, apples will help to maintain white and healthy teeth.

1440,e2RBRUFwmuw,Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok (Chinatown) in Jakarta - DELICIOUS Indonesia Food!,"‚ñ∫Check out 50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...Glodok is the Chinatown of Jakarta, and my wife and I decided to spend the day walking around Glodok and exploring some Indonesian street food throughout the day. At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.Since we were staying at a hotel (here‚Äôs information on the hotel I stayed at:https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn‚Äôt take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta‚Äôs Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.It probably wasn‚Äôt the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!Here‚Äôs the list of the things we ate and the prices:Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) eachFried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged? Do you think?Hope you enjoyed the Indonesian street food tour of Glodok and Fatahillah Square, I sure enjoyed eating it!--MY WEBSITES:Camera I use: https://migrationology.com/travel-res...T-shirts: https://migrationology.com/store/Migrationology.com: http://migrationology.com/EatingThaiFood.com: http://eatingthaifood.com/TravelByYing.com: http://travelbyying.com/SOCIAL MEDIA:Snapchat: @migrationologyInstagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology‚ñ∫Jakarta Travel Guide: https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...‚ñ∫50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...--",Food

So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn‚Äôt eat that much of it.Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there‚Äôs a version that‚Äôs comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I‚Äôve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.Jacuzzi braised ¬Ω chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq.

1445,awtmTJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

You‚Äôll discover an ocean of fresh ingredients available in the parking lot before 8 am.

They are so good, the beef in my opinion was tastier than the beef.For our sticky rice Lao feast throwdown, we ordered a bunch of different dishes and all ate them  together. We had some stews, some jaew, sticky rice, a few grilled items, and the highlight for me was a stuffed fish. Total price - 117,000 LAK ($14.00)Sandwich - 5,000 LAK ($0.60) - On the outside of Khua Din Market in Vientiane you‚Äôll find a few stalls selling khao gee pate, the Laos version of French baguette sandwiches with pate and toppings. They are not the best quality, but for 5,000 kip, they are a bargain and really do taste pretty good.Evening Cooked Food Market - For this Vientiane street food tour, in the evening we headed to Ban Anou Night Market, a peaceful evening market where you‚Äôll find a good selection of Lao food. Khao Piak Sen - First we had a bowl of khao piak sen. Total price - 15,000 LAK ($1.80)Next we had some stew dishes, and an order of green papaya salad, all of which were delicious. Total price - 65,000 LAK ($7.78)Finally to end this Lao street food tour of Vientiane, Joel and I enjoyed some wonderful dried beef.

Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: https://goo.gl/M14aZWRavshan‚Äôs Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...Uzbekistan Day 1: TashkentOn Day 1 in Uzbekistan we went on an ultimate Uzbek street food tour in Tashkent, including the biggest bazaar in the city, and the most massive plov (rice pilau) cooking in Tashkent.We had arrived at the airport in Tashkent at about 4 am in the morning, and at 9 am we were ready to start eating our way through the city. First we met up with Bekruz and Akbar both from the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan (Bekruz is the one who invited me to Uzbekistan and arranged everything for us, so thank you Bekruz!), and Ravshan (check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...), a local food vlogger in Uzbekistan.Two of the most important phrases you should know in Uzbek are:Assalomu Alaykum - Hello / GreetingRahmat - Thank youBread Bazaar, Tashkent - We started this ultimate street food tour at the bread bazaar in Tashkent, a market dedicated fully to bread, with a little fruit and other things mixed in. We bought some break, some kaymak, and some fruit and then went to a nearby restaurant where they laid everything on the table for us, along with tea. Uzbek breakfast was a great way to get started.Chorsu Bazaar - The grandest bazaar in Tashkent is Chorus Bazaar, and it‚Äôs a perfect place to get a feel of Uzbek culture and food. We first stopped at the food court to try hanum, a type of dumpling filled with potato and somsa. Then we continued to the dome shaped iconic part of the bazaar, filled with fresh meat and spices. It‚Äôs one of the coolest market structures anywhere in the world.Plov Center - We kind of had to rush out of Chorsu Bazaar because although they prepare 1,500 Kilos, seriously, of rice plov per day, it only takes 2 - 3 hours before they run out everyday. So we got there, already one of the monster swimming pool pans was finished, but they still had a few others going and serving. Plov is the national dish of Uzbekistan, a food that‚Äôs eaten on every and all occasions. For Tashkent plov, it‚Äôs pretty heavy on the meat at oil, with rice, chickpeas, and raisins. Also it included, qazi - horsemeat sausage which is a delicacy. It was incredibly delicious, and proper meal experience.Total price - 100,000 UZS ($12.21)Plov is love, remember that when you‚Äôre in Uzbekistan.National Food Restaurant - After strolling around for a while in the afternoon, we continued to a National Food restaurant, a laid back family style restaurant that serves all things Uzbek food. Along with a number of dishes, the main dish I was most interested in was the naryn, thin slices of dough mixed with minced meat and horse. It was interesting, and quite good, as were the other dishes.Total price - 110,000 UZS ($13.43)Sultan Suleyman Restaurant - For dinner we went to a bit of a fancy trendy restaurant, and had another platter of food. This time, dough noodle like sheets topped with meat, horse sausage again, and green onions.Total price - 122,000 UZS ($14.90)It was a day of learning, eating, and meeting some amazing people along the way.

I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.

1461,slwgXXVXM3I,"üá∫üá∏ Fast food, Fat profits: Obesity in America | Fault Lines","Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. How did the situation get so out of hand? On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.People featured in this film: Marion Nestle, Marlene Schwartz, John Bode, Nelson Eusebio, J.

1462,J3H4qIWx9Tc,34 DELICIOUS FOOD HACKS WITH CHEESE AND OTHER GOODIES,"Simple recipes with cheese for everyoneThere is no denying that cheese is delicious, especially when it comes to cooking with cheese. There are limitless recipes you can try with all different varieties of cheese, such as mozzarella, parmesan cheese or cheddar cheese. Since it is such a delicious ingredient for cooking and filled with protein we created some simple and delicious recipes with cheese that can try right away. In addition, we included some bonus cooking hacks and tips to make your time in the kitchen more enjoyable.1. Simplest macaroni and cheese recipe.If you are at work or would like to have macaroni and cheese as a snack instead of making a huge pot of food. Try this little trick that will literally take you 3 minutes to make this meal. In a mug, add a scoop of pasta, then, add the adequate amount of water and microwave for 2 minutes. Stir it really well and make sure there is no more water left in the mug. Then add some milk and cheese and stir until the cheese into the mug and Bon Appetite.2. Delicious cheese toastie recipeIf you would like to have a nice cheese toast fast but you don't own a grill, don't let that stop you. Apply some butter on a slice of bread on both sides, then, add two slices of cheddar cheese and then another slice of bread with butter spread on it. Then, place your sandwich in a kitchen foil and seal it. After that, take your clothing iron and place it on top of the toastie for a couple of minutes max, then turn it and press the other side as well with your clothing iron and, there you have it.3. DIY cheddar sticksThis might as well be the most delicious treat in the whole world. Take a block of cheddar cheese and cut it in rectangular blocks. Place one wooden stick in each block. Then, dip it into flour, after that dip it into an egg wash, and finally in breadcrumbs. Lastly, boil some oil and fry your cheesy sticks. Enjoy with some ketchup or the sauce of your choice.4. Oil Hack!Instead of accidentally pouring excess oil on your food or your frying pan. Pour some oil in a clean spray bottle and start spraying. This way you'll be able to monitor how much oil you consume and also keep your meals healthier.5.How to make your own iced coffeeMake your filter coffee, or your espresso, or your instant coffee with hot water as you would normally do with or without sugar. (Do Not add milk). Then pour it into your ice tray and place it in the freezer. When it's time for you to have a nice glass of iced coffee, instead of running to the closest coffee shop, just take 5-6 cubes of the iced coffee you prepared, place them in a glass with some milk or water and stir. Enjoy!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timestamps:0:07 - DIY mugshot mac and cheese0:33 - Cool cheese toastie1:12 - Cheese grate hack1:34 - DIY cheesy sticks2:13 - Delicious ham and cheese toastie recipe4:02 - Cookie decorating trick4:32 - How to reseal a plastic bag5:04 - How to make your bananas last longer5:20 - Amazing oil trick5:51 - How to soften hard bread6:07 - Frozen yogurt treats6:22 - DIY peeler6:34 - Strawberry and chocolate recipe7:34  - Ice tray hacks8:01 - How to make iced coffee8:51 - Oreo cookies trick9:23 - How to cut a watermelon (easy) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/5Minute.Craf...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/Twitter: https://twitter.com/5m_craftsSubscribe to 5-Minute MAGIC: http://bit.ly/2ldditZ5-Minute Crafts KIDS: https://goo.gl/PEuLVtThe Bright Side of Youtube: https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/Music by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/",Food

A great environment, and the coffee was excellent.Price - 1.80 EUR per cupKostarelos Deli - Tassos knows his Greek cheese and he says Kostarelos Deli has some of the best cheese in Athens.Total price - 14.60 EURMam - Mam is often considered the best Greek cheese pie in Athens, and it‚Äôs a  perfect street food kind of place. Most people take-away, but they have a standing table as well. The classic Greek cheese pie was my favorite.Total price - 4.80 EURVarvakios Market - This is the Athens central market for meat and seafood. It‚Äôs a beautiful market and any lover would enjoy walking around this amazing market.Miran - Pastourma and Soutzouki - This is a really cool little deli in Athens where you can buy for takeaway or order whatever you see and sit at one of the tables to snack.

Amazing.Price - 2.20 EUR per pieceTaverna To Trigono - For dinner, Tassos wanted to take us to one of his favorite restaurants in Athens, a little outside of the city in a place called Kalyvia Thorikou.

Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!?

1502,4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,"DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTYWe love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole. Make incisions on bread and fill with the sauce (mix rosemary, garlic, and olive oil). Bake for 25 minutes.

1503,Stk71Bdz4Nw,Best & Worst Foods for Skin | Healthy Food,"Watch more How to Eat Healthy Food videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/501162-...Some of the best foods for your skin health are foods that are rich in beta-carotenes. Those are foods like carrots and yams, that you probably already knew about. But some of the other foods that are really rich in beta-carotenes and all the other carotenoids are those green leafy vegetables. And those actually give your skin that beautiful healthy glow that you associate with the people that hang out in health food stores. But you also want to make sure you're hydrated. Water is one of the best ingredients for your healthy skin recipe, because water actually helps to flush your skin regularly. It keeps you hydrated, makes sure your skin is plump and not drawn and wrinkly. It's also important to know about the worst foods for your skin. Some of the worst foods for your skin are sugars, which can cause inflammation and breakout, and exacerbate any skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis. You also probably want to avoid most caffeine. Caffeine can cause you to be slightly dehydrated, and sometimes your caffeine comes with extra doses of sugar and dairy, which can also take on that inflammatory response.",Food

1515,qu645wvzMwQ,Top 10 Alkaline Foods You Should Be Eating Everyday,"Not many people are aware, but the human body functions the best at a pH level that is slightly on the alkaline side. pH levels can range from 0, or completely acidic, to 14, completely alkaline. Ideally, the body‚Äôs pH levels should sit around 7.35 to 7.45 in order to function properly. Unfortunately, the majority of people consume a highly processed diet that is high in sugar. This causes the body‚Äôs pH to become acidic. Therefore, most of the people walking around today have pH levels that are not stabilized and are acidic. Luckily, the pH in the human body can be restored. Today‚Äôs video will discuss ten powerful foods that are consumed on the alkaline diet and can improve one‚Äôs health. 1. SpinachSpinach is a powerful vegetable that has many health characteristics, including its alkaline effects. This is largely due to it‚Äôs high content of chlorophyll, which causes the spinach to be an alkalizing agent to the body and restore the pH level back to its ideal. 2. LemonsThis may be surprising, as lemons are often seen as an acidic fruit.  However, they are actually high in alkaline properties. This is because once the citric acid in lemons are metabolized, they provide an alkaline effect on the body. They help to cleanse and detox the body, using essential minerals like calcium and iron. 3. KaleKale is another powerful green that should be added to a daily diet. It has the ability to stabilize the body‚Äôs pH levels, while providing detoxification and antioxidant properties. Kale contains Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Vitamin C, Magnesium, Calcium, Copper, Potassium, Iron, Protein, Phosphorus and Manganese. 4. AvocadosAvocados are another one of those foods that are packed with essential vitamins and minerals that help to flush out harmful toxins from the body and help to restore the body‚Äôs pH level to its optimum level. By doing so, avocados help the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the circulatory system and the digestive system. 5. WheatgrassWheatgrass also helps to detoxify the body. In doing so, it also helps to protect the liver from harmful toxins. Since it contains essential vitamins and minerals, along with ridding the body of toxins that weigh it down, wheatgrass helps to boost energy, lose weight, stabilize blood sugar and fight cancerous cells. 6. CeleryCelery is a healthful food that is not given the credit it is deserved. Celery is normally found on every diet‚Äôs menu. This is largely because celery is a diuretic, as it helps the body to get rid of any excess fluids. Celery can also neutralize the acid in the body and bring the pH level back to a slightly alkaline level. 7. BroccoliBroccoli is one of the most important foods to eat in order to maintain an alkalized pH levels. That is because broccoli contains phytochemicals that alkalize the body, reduce estrogen dominance and increase estrogen metabolism. Broccoli also contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. 8. CucumbersCucumbers are another food that have a high water content and help to flush out harmful toxins from the body. They can help to restore the pH level of the body by neutralizing the acids. They also help to reduce any inflammation within the body. 9. Bell PeppersOne highly underestimated food is the bell pepper. Not only can the bell pepper help to neutralize the acid in the body and raise the pH level to alkaline, but it can help to reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and fight cancer. 10. Garlic Like many contained in this list, garlic has so many healthy characteristics that go far beyond restoring the pH level in the body. Garlic helps to support the body‚Äôs overall health. It contains Vitamin B1, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Calcium, Copper, Selenium and Manganese. It acts as an antibacterial food, an antiviral food, an antioxidant food, and an anti-fungal food.

1518,NGxcr_Z8Dmw,5 Must-Try Japanese Food Experiences in Tokyo,"Japanese Food is awesome, and the overall dining experience is just as fun. If you are looking for places to eat in Tokyo, here are five great Japanese food experiences that I love while living in Tokyo. 1. Japanese Grill (Robata) - You sit around a few men who cook all of the meat and vegetables right in front of you on a grill. You just point to what you want and they grab it with their giant wooden spatulas. 2. Ramen - My favorite Japanese food, and perhaps the most well recognized Japanese dish apart from sushi. There are hundreds of places to choose from in Tokyo, each with their own rendition of the classic. One spot where you can get a large variety of options is on ""Ramen Street"" in the lower level of Tokyo Station. 3. Yakitori - Meat and veggies on sticks, cooked over a similar grill as the Robata, Yakitori is a favorite among Tokyo residents because it's fast and goes great with beer. The most famous area for Yakitori in Tokyo is down ""Memory Lane"" or ""Piss Alley"" just outside the Shinjuku Train Station. 4. Chanko Nabe - The ultimate in gluttony for a normal civilian, but a necessary bulking strategy for up-and-coming sumo wresters in the Ryogoku neighborhood of Tokyo. There are many different versions of this massive stew, and they are all aggressive and delicious. 5. Conveyor Belt Sushi - As I mention in the video, there are a million different ways sushi is served in Tokyo. One of the most fun methods is by way of the conveyor belt sushi. *Bonus* - Convenient stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson's, and 7 Eleven are a major part of Japanese Food culture in Tokyo. People are busy and need a quick meal, so I wanted to take you around real quick and show you what's inside! ---SUBSCRIBE ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/TravelDeeper---FOLLOW ME: + INSTAGRAM ‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/tourist2townie+ FACEBOOK ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/tourist2townie+ TWITTER ‚ñ∫ https://twitter.com/tourist2townie+ SNAPCHAT ‚ñ∫@GarethChat+ WEB ‚ñ∫ http://www.tourist2townie.com---MY TRAVEL VLOGGING GEAR: - MacBook Pro 15‚Äù ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2g9K6j3- LaCie Rugged External Hard Drive ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2fkojHR- Sony a7ii ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gCeBDj- Sony a7ii 24-70 Lens ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2fhWexs- DJI Phantom 4 Drone ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2g9ALI4- GoPro Hero 4 ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gvfJYI- KNEKT Underwater Dome ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gez11u - Rode Shotgun Mic ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gvg5yg- Manfrotto 60‚Äù Compact Action Tripod ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gducpn- Joby Tripod ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gdo6FA- Zoom H2n Handy Recorder ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gdmKuE- Backup Batteries for Sony A7ii ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2fhYchl- Backup Batteries for Sony RX100iv ‚Üí http://amzn.to/2gvbqfO---P.S.

It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it‚Äôs a city that I‚Äôve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....) and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you‚Äôll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem! We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I‚Äôve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.Here‚Äôs all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:Hummus AcramawiPrice - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plateAlmond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)Al-shuala Grill RestaurantShawarma - 26 ILS ($7.26)Al Baghdadi KababPalestinian kebabsTotal price - 100 ILS ($27.89)Zalatimo SweetsMutabakPrice - 30 ILS ($8.37) eachPeaches - 10 for 1 kgPlums - 10 for 1 kgFruit - 10 ILS ($2.76) per kg.Mahane Yehuda MarketAzura RestaurantTotal price - 400 ILS ($111.55)Western Wall (Wailing Wall)Western Wall TunnelPrice - 35 ILS ($9.76) per personDome of the RockMount of OlivesMachneyuda RestaurantTotal price - 700 ILS ($195.21)It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.Thank you again to David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....) and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!-MUSIC in This Video:  Souls of Time, Arabian Feast - https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):GH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkII would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thank you for watching!",Food

But did you know that some of these products are completely banned in other countries? They contain substances and chemicals that might be approved by the FDA, but are illegal by any other food administration. Let‚Äôs explore 10 foods banned in other countries!Let‚Äôs start with artificial dyes. You probably know that M&Ms and other sweets contain artificial dyes that contribute to the product‚Äôs color and make it more appealing. But those dyes have been banned in Europe and many other countries around the world and replaced with natural dyes as they contain several harmful substances!Wild salmon is considered as one of the healthiest foods with plenty of nutritional benefits. But did you know that many countries banned farm-raised salmon? Wait until you hear just how harmful salmon is for the environment and why it‚Äôs been banned in Australia as well as New Zealand!We often hear about zero-calorie chips which are considered healthy. It‚Äôs due to a fat substitute called Olestra. But this substitute seems to have negative effects on our health! While it removes fat from products, it actually stops the body from receiving some of the most essential vitamins and nutrients, which is why it was banned in Canada and Europe.Do you consume meat, Rice Krispies, sports drinks, calorie-free snacks, fruit, or GMO food? All of those have been banned from countries around the world because they include harmful substances that have negative effects on your health!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.thethings.com/",Food

1551,5RwIWGkMxrE,Food Fight: How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters‚Äìled by Alice Waters‚Äìvoiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

1557,Akwm2UZJ34o,Hot Food - Kids' Poems and Stories With Michael Rosen,"Hot Food - Read by Michael Rosen fro The HypnotiserYou can browse and buy Michael Rosen Books here:http://bit.ly/MichaelRosenBooks ""I wrote a book of poems for children called 'The Hypnotiser' some years ago and then it went out of print. I couldn't get anyone to reprint it, so I asked my son Joe to film me performing the book."" - Michael RosenCheck out Michael's website for news, updates and fun.https://www.michaelrosen.co.uk Go behind the scenes and see how our videos are made:https://workbyjoe.wordpress.com/2015/... Who is Michael Rosen?My first book for children was called Mind Your Own Business and it came out in 1974. Quentin Blake did wonderful line drawings for it.Ever since then, I‚Äôve been doing these things:Writing booksWriting articles for newspapers and magazinesGoing to schools, libraries and theatres and performing the poems in my booksHelping children write poems and storiesMaking radio programmes, mostly about words, language or booksAppearing on TV, either reading books, or talking about booksTeaching at universities about children‚Äôs literatureRunning workshops for teachers about poetryIn any week, I might be doing all of these things! To tell the truth, I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing tomorrow, unless I look in my diary to see.Review Right class 6, RIGHT CLASS 6, I'm talking, I'm talking, I want complete quiet and that includes you, David Alexander, yes you...' 'The Outing', by Michael Rosen, just one of the fantastic and hilarious poems from his short story and poetry collection The Hypnotiser. This particular poem was read to me as a young child in primary school time and time again. Each time the names in the poem were changed to the names of the pupils in my class. It never got old, or less hilarious and I wouldn't hesitate in reading this to my future classes during my teaching career.Other great poems from this collection include 'The Car Trip'; a highlight of the sibling chaos that goes on in the back of the car when Mum is driving: 'He started it. I didn't. He started it...', 'Tomato 1'; the gruelling ordeal of being given a tomato to eat by your mother and you simply just hate tomatoes, and 'Tidy Your Room'; every child's nightmare. Each and every poem and short story relates to children through typical experiences that most would have endured. This book enlightens children's love and enthusiasm for poetry, an almost forgotten about genre for most children; a runner up to fiction books.This book can have many uses in the classroom; appropriate for children in Key Stage Two it can be read by the teacher at the end of the day during story time, like in my own experience at primary school. Or, during a poetry topic in Literacy, this book could model fun, interesting, age appropriate poetry that will inspire children to write their own poems. Likewise for shared reading; this book would be fantastic to put under the visualiser and look through with the class at the how poems are written, their structure, do they rhyme? do they tell a story? All sorts of things can be addressed with the class as a whole.This book needs to be shown to children, whether at school on the class bookshelf, or online where you can find video clips of Michael Rosen performing these poems; a great filler for those odd five minutes that arise during the busy school day. A Must read, not just for children but teachers as well!#Michael Rosen#Kids#Poetry",Food

1583,TeLiBBxIbaw,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,"Whether it‚Äôs rotten cheese consumed by maggots, or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy, here are foods you‚Äôre not allowed to eat in the USSubscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv6. Mirabelle PlumDon‚Äôt get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won‚Äôt get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the big deal‚Äù? They‚Äôre just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It‚Äôs somewhat of a mystery why exactly they‚Äôre banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France, most countries have agreed not to sell them. It‚Äôs a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be, you aren‚Äôt allowed to eat them, cuz we said so! 5. Unpasteurized MilkMost of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860‚Äôs and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it‚Äôs from the mom to the offspring4. Lazy CakesThis cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough, they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn‚Äôt found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre not your average brownie, and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 3. Pig‚Äôs Blood CakeWho on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese, good job! Pig‚Äôs blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It‚Äôs basically like a street food delicacy that‚Äôs made with soy broth, sticky rice and oh yeah, pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it, you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it‚Äôs still banned here!2. Conch QueenThis beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It‚Äôs actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.Purple Mangosteen One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn‚Äôt eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it‚Äôs found in the US! The problem isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out, which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don‚Äôt want this thing in our country! It‚Äôs been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.",Food

Yup, these foods are so unpopular now! However, just 20‚Äì40 years ago they were flying off the grocery store shelves!

They came up with the idea of serving ready-made food frozen on a convenient tray.- If you ever ate dinner at your grandma‚Äôs house as a kid, you probably tasted the stuff once or twice. Gelatin was first used in dishes back in medieval Europe and was partly made from the collagen in animal bones.- Back in 1968, many kids could be seen sipping on a cold bottle of SunnyD as a part of a well-balanced breakfast ‚Äî and it was anything but. SunnyD tasted super sweet because it was primarily made of corn syrup and contained less than 5% juice. - One Hi-C Wild Cherry juice box contained a whopping 27 g of sugar, which is more than the American Heart Association recommends grown women ingest in a day ‚Äî and these were intended for kids! - Back in the late ‚Äô80s and ‚Äò90s, Bubble Tape was a fan fave! But ever, since sugar-free gum became more popular and oral health, became more of a priority, this sugary sweet gum just wasn‚Äôt as desirable anymore.- Ambrosia salad was usually found at family gatherings back when you or your parents were younger. This sweet salad actually came onto the scene back in the 1800s and usually featured special sweet treats that only appeared on special occasions. - Once people realized how bad trans fats were for them during the ‚Äò90s, Crisco stopped being used as often.- It wasn‚Äôt until the 1950s that cottage cheese became incredibly popular. It‚Äôs very mild in flavor and isn‚Äôt super high in fat, which was appealing to people from the ‚Äò50s into the ‚Äò70s.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCPhotos: https://www.depositphotos.comEast News----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",Food

Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America‚Äôs most critical ‚Äì and challenging ‚Äì public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity.

1611,W2L_02p-xns,6 High Estrogen Foods MEN SHOULD AVOID!,"These are 6 High Estrogen Foods Men Should Avoid to build muscle, lose weight, and get lean. Some foods should be limited and others should be completely avoided. Instead of increasing estrogen most men want to learn how to increase testosterone naturally & fast. By learning how to decrease estrogen levels, weight loss becomes much easier. üî• FREE 6 Week Body Transformation Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat5Fat Loss Calculator: http://bit.ly/2S5ltXiTimestamps:Soy - 0:41 Wheat and grain based products - 2:32 Processed Carbs and Refined Sugars - 3:52Beer - 5:28 Beans - 7:12Bottled Water - 8:27The next food that you'll want to limit to keep your estrogen levels down is wheat and grain based products. These foods are extremely high in a type of xenoestrogen known as zearalenone or ZEA. ZEA is molecularly similar to estrogen and acts like estrogen in the body. One study examined the effect that ZEAs had on a drug called Letrozole, which is specifically designed to lower estrogen levels in the body. Bodybuilders will often take it get to really low levels of body fat. The researchers found that, even small amounts of ZEA negated the effects of Letrozole. That‚Äôs a powerful indicator of the estrogen boosting effect of all those ZEA‚Äôs that are found in wheat and grain products. As well as the ZEA problem, wheat also contains phytoestrogens. They‚Äôre found in the wheat germ which is the reproductive part of the wheat seed. These phytoestrogens will bind to estrogen receptor sites in your body‚Äôs cells. In a study that was designed to investigate the combined effect of wheat germ and a breast cancer treatment pharmaceutical it was noted that one of the side effects of wheat germ was that it increased estrogen receptor activity of MCF-7 cells. However, refined grain products remove the germ, making them slightly less of a problem when it comes to estrogen. Overall though, you should limit your consumption of wheat and grain based products. Our third estrogen food type to avoid is processed carbs and refined sugars. Hopefully, you‚Äôve already cut back on these types of foods if you're trying to bring your body fat levels down. But there‚Äôs an extra reason to ditch these types of carbs. And it has to do with that powerful blood sugar regulating hormone, insulin. As well as causing you to store more body fat, insulin lowers your body‚Äôs levels of what is known as sex hormone binding globulin. The job of this globulin is to bind the two sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen, together. When it's doing its job properly, you will have limited amounts of free estrogen in your body. But, when it's stopped from doing its job, the opposite will be the case, your free estrogen levels will be much higher. It‚Äôs the insulin response that occurs when you eat refined sugar foods that causes the interference in the activity of sex hormone binding globulin. An interesting study that focused on women showed that drinking sugar laden sodas increased estrogen levels. The interesting thing was that increased estrogen levels did not occur with either diet sodas or fruit juices. Researchers believe this is due to the fact that diet sodas don‚Äôt contain refined sugar and fruit juice contains natural fruit sugars. Another estrogen related problem with sugar consumption is that, eating too much sugar leads to an increase in stored body fat. Fat cells excrete estrogen. So, the more fat cells that you have sitting around your body, the more estrogen you‚Äôll have floating around as well. This is additional to the estrogen produced by the endocrine system. So, rather than reaching for a sweet sugar saturated treat, do your estrogen levels a favor and opt for foods that are high in proteins, fiber and healthy fats. Our fourth no go food for estrogen is beer. I know, this is a tough one. Now, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt drink it at all, but if you want to get really lean and maximize your muscle mass and strength, then you gotta‚Äô cut back on the booze.  Here‚Äôs why. As you know beer contains hops. But what are hops? Well, they're actually the female part of the hop plant. They‚Äôre a preservative that has been added to beer forüî• FREE 6 Week Body Transformation Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat5References:https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/track...https://www.cell.com/cell-chemical-bi...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1...https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article...https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publicatio...https://www.nature.com/articles/s4146...https://www.sciencedirect.com/science...http://jmclachlan.tulane.edu/PDFs/bou...https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/a...https://www.cambridge.org/core/journa...",Food

1614,RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten BoschProducer / Directors 'Food Matters'PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  ""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""- Dr Joseph Mercola - Mercola.com",Food

1618,F9To5UjWhUA,Osaka Street Food Guide: Dotonbori ‚òÖ ONLY in JAPAN #23 Â§ßÈò™ÈÅìÈ†ìÂ†ÄÈ£ü„ÅÑÂÄí„ÇåÊåëÊà¶,"Osaka is known as Japan's kitchen and for good reason! It's loaded with some of the best and cheapest restaurants and street stands anywhere. Enter Dotonbori, the old entertainment district of Osaka that's also ground zero for cheap and easy to find street food. John Daub and Kevin Riley, a long-term resident of Osaka take their stomachs down the Dotonbori strip. We also introduce a very Osakan word: ""Kuidaore"" meaning eat until you drop! Street food on Dotonbori:‚òÖ Takoyaki„ÄÄCalled ""octopus ball"" by newbies to Japan, these round treats normally come topped with a tangy thick soy sauce, Japanese mayonaise, and dried fish and seaweed. Some shops go even further adding half boiled eggs or mountains of green negi! A bowl of 6 to 8 balls costs 380 to 450 Yen. Recommended shop: Creo-Ru Takoyaki‚òÖ KushikatsuAnother Osaka specialty you can find at a few stands. It's skewered and battered meats and vegetables deep fried until golden. pTake each skewer and dip it once in the special bath bin near the table or register. You won't be disappointed! Vegetables start at 60 yen and meats at 150 yen. Large Tiger Shrimps can go for 380 yen for one! Prices are listed on the menu outside the shop. ‚òÖ GyozaOsaka has it's own variety of dumplings. What's different? It's cheaper and made in Osaka! 180 yen for 6 gyoza! ‚òÖ RamenA few shops serve up hot bowls on the street side. Get a ticket at the vending machine for about 600 yen and enjoy!Recommended shop: Kinryu Ramen (The one with the Dragon!)‚òÖ Crab legsWho would have thought crab was big in Osaka, but one of the most dominant restaurants serve them char-grilled right at the front of the street. The also have kani miso or ""crab brains"" served in a half shell. 500 yen for that. Yum.Recommended shop: Kani Doraku‚òÖ More!!! The more you walk around, the more Dotonbori will surprise you.

1619,go_QOzc79Uc,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.Join Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution: http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/...TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes.

Dr Peter Glidden discusses the 12 Bad Foods to avoid if you want optimum health. When you eliminate these foods you'll find your digestive system begins to work more efficiently. This means you'll be receiving more nutrition from your food. It's the lack of nutrition which often causes weight gain as the body can go into patterns of binge eating in an attempt to receive enough nutrition. All chronic diseases are directly related to nutrient deficiencies, so it's vital to ensure your digestive system is working at its best. https://young1.life/",Food

She begins cooking each morning in order to make it to the market and set up her cart by 2pm. To cook the bugs, Mrs. Pan first adds oil and chopped pandan leaves to a frying pan. The pandan leaves add a nice fragrance to the bugs while cutting the bitter taste. She adds her first round of bugs and allows them to fry for roughly 30 minutes. She allows the crickets to cook for only 15 minutes. To enhance the flavors, she does not clean the pan between bugs. Then she‚Äôs off to the market, to fill hungry bellies with bugs! üí∏PRICE: 1.50 USD/50 THB for Mixed Bowl of Bugs 1.20 USD/40 THB for Giant Water Bug2.

1699,f9P5Phj0TFY,A taste of conflict: The politics of food in Jerusalem - Street Food,"The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to three different faiths: for Jews it is the site of their first holy temple; for Christians it is the scene of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection; and for Muslims it is the location of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven.A site of vast historical and religious significance, this beautiful city is also a tragic one - fought over for centuries and coveted by millions who have never set foot in it. It is at the heart of the ongoing and seemingly irresolvable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and everything there is overshadowed by politics.Jerusalem's old city enthralls with its bustling markets and vibrant street life, but inside its walls, tensions are never far from the surface. History is a dimension of the present and there is little unity to be found in a city which Palestinians regard as their occupied capital.In the struggle for the soul of a city, even food - a marker of identity, an expression of history, culture, and values - plays a part, and the roots of certain foods are fiercely debated.For Palestinians, denied a state and with a national identity which is constantly undermined, food plays an even greater role in defining who they are.Almost half of Israeli Jews come from Middle Eastern backgrounds where their parents and grandparents lived alongside Arabs in countries such as Iraq, Yemen and Morocco. Many dishes are a reminder of the shared history and culture of Arabs and Jews - something easily forgotten in today's divided politics. In a city where Israelis and Palestinians attach great meaning and symbolism to food - whether religious, political or both - we visit a unique place, Eucalyptus, which is jointly owned by Palestinians and Israelis.There, we sample dishes made by an Israeli Jew, a Palestinian Muslim, an Armenian, and a Palestinian Christian who, as 'Chefs for Peace', cook together to bridge religious and political divides. Convinced that ignorance about the other is at the heart of the conflict, the chefs try to educate people about others' history, traditions, and culture through the medium of food.

1702,tKoUcEcz1dM,8 Foods that Are Actually Damaging Your Kidneys,"Have you ever noticed that final powerful spray of water at the carwash before your vehicle gets a rapid blow dry? The water jets pulverize any remaining remnants of dirt.That‚Äôs one way to view how our kidneys work. Their job is to flush out toxins from the blood by way of urine. The National Institutes of Health reports that our kidneys filter an excess of 200 quarts of blood daily. That translates into 2 quarts of waste each day. They don‚Äôt get holidays or weekends off; they work day and night.Thankfully, our kidneys can wash away impurities while retaining vital nutrients floating around in our blood. Keeping our internal filters healthy and functioning properly is invaluable for nourishment and detoxification of our bodies. So naturally, whatever we eat and drink has a dramatic impact on our kidneys‚Äô health. A steady diet of unhealthy food and drinks can strain their performance, and put us at risk.The good news is, it‚Äôs never too late to improve your diet and lifestyle, even if your kidneys are already impaired. In today‚Äôs video we will see how our kidneys react to too much consumption of 8 different foods and beverages.1. Red meatWe‚Äôve all heard that protein is good for our health. But too much of anything can be harmful. For example, a diet that is high in red meat, which contains lots of animal protein, can damage our kidneys. The reason? Our kidneys need to metabolism this protein. When there‚Äôs a conveyor belt of rich protein headed toward the kidneys for cleansing, they  just can‚Äôt keep up with the pace. When kidneys can‚Äôt eliminate waste products, there will be a build-up of acidic residue in our body.It‚Äôs always good to talk to your health care professional about the diet that‚Äôs right for you.2.  AlcoholJust like eating too much red meat can strain our kidneys, the same is true with too much alcohol; they will be unable to properly filter our blood. Also, too much alcohol can cause dehydration. This creates a domino effect: if our blood is dehydrated, our cells and organs will not be able to function properly.3. Table SaltWhile our bodies require sodium to maintain proper fluid balance ‚Äì especially in our electrolytes - an excess amount will cause kidneys to retain water. Too much salt can also increase the amount of protein that is eliminated in urine.4. CaffeineCaffeine is a stimulant which millions of people depend upon every morning to help them become fully awake. But all of that caffeine in coffee, tea and sodas can jolt your kidneys into overdrive. The stimulant accelerates blood flow, which in turn increases blood pressure.Caffeine has another effect ‚Äì it can lead to dehydration, just as salt can. Too much dehydration can lead to kidney stones. Most health experts recommend you drink no more than 2 cups of coffee or 3 cups of tea daily. Soda and energy drinks are beverages you may want to eliminate completely. Another source of caffeine is cocoa, which should also be consumed moderately.5. Artificial SweetenersRefined sugar has had a bad rap lately. That‚Äôs why companies began creating artificial sweeteners. It may sound better for our health, but they can still negatively impact kidney function. Try instead to steer away from artificial sweeteners and use stevia or honey to flavor your food and beverages.6. Dairy ProductsWhile dairy products are an excellent source of protein, they should be consumed in moderation, especially for anyone who has kidney disease. The reason?  Too many dairy products will increase calcium in urine which can lead to kidney stones. Also, as kidneys are overworked, they won‚Äôt be able to regulate protein waste and it will rise to an unhealthy level.7. Carbonated BeveragesSodas and energy drinks are usually the chief instigator for kidney problems; they are loaded with caffeine, sugar or artificial sweeteners. They may taste better than thirst-quenching water or lemon water but they aren‚Äôt providing any health benefits for your kidneys.8. Genetically Modified Foods (GMOs)In recent years, crops have been the recipient of various forms of herbicides and pesticides. This includes everything from strawberries to rice. These chemical alterations can create even more problems for those who are already suffering from some type of kidney ailment.-----------------------------------------------------Disclaimer: The materials and the information contained on Natural Cures channel are provided for general and educational purposes only and do not constitute any legal, medical or other professional advice on any subject matter.

1713,03vWwqYPf60,Organic food - hype or hope? | DW Documentary,"There is growing demand in the western world for organic food. But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?Is organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk ""organic"" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

1720,iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,"Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world‚Äôs cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they‚Äôre made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they‚Äôre so light and airy, unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It‚Äôs basically a minced-meat, skinless sausage that‚Äôs deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‚Äòfrinkandel speciaal‚Äô is eaten with mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It‚Äôs melted cheese, usually Gouda, inside a doughy wrap that‚Äôs then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes, the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It‚Äôs pretty much deep fried cheese so what‚Äôs not to love?Krokets are a Dutch food you‚Äôll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed, it‚Äôs also deep fried. It‚Äôs long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy, rolled into logs, breaded, and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It‚Äôs crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and, while it‚Äôs still warm, breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together, using the syrup as glue. They‚Äôre very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food, which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken, potato, hard boiled egg, noodles with peanut sauce, rice, vegetables and bread. For dessert, we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. I included fries in this video even though they‚Äôre Belgian, not Dutch. But they‚Äôre really popular in The Netherlands and I didn‚Äôt think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I‚Äôd love to know which food you‚Äôd most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or, if you‚Äôve already tried them, which is your favourite?Subtitles available in English and Spanish!

1756,8Ug1MnU6LKw,Unprocessed -- how I gave up processed foods (and why it matters) | Megan Kimble | TEDxTucsonSalon,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. n January of 2012, Megan Kimble was a city-dwelling 26-year-old‚Äîbusy and broke, living in a small apartment without so much as a garden plot to her name. But she cared about food: where it came from, how it was made, and what it did to her body. So she set herself a challenge: She would go an entire year without eating processed foods. In this talk, she discusses what makes a food processed and how those processes impact our bodies and communities.Megan Kimble is the managing editor of Edible Baja Arizona, a local food magazine serving Tucson and the borderlands, and is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times. Her book, Unprocessed, about her year of eating only whole, unprocessed food, is forthcoming from William Morrow in 2015. Follow along at megankimble.com.

Writing cores ‚Äì made from a mixture of graphite and clay ‚Äì are placed into the grooves. Coloring pencils may use wax-based cores while many other formulations are used in cosmetic pencils.12 Steps to Pencil Perfection............STEP 1Chunks of graphite (a soft, dark mineral) and clay are placed inside a huge rotating drum. Large rocks inside the drum crush the graphite and clay into a fine powder. Then water is added, and the mixture is blended in the drum for up to three days.STEP 2A machine squeezes all the water out of the mixture leaving behind a grey sludge. Here, a worker puts the sludge in a cabinet where it air dries and hardens for four days.STEP 3Huge wheels grind the dried sludge into another fine powder, and water is blended in again to make a soft paste.STEP 4The paste is pushed through a metal tube and comes out in the shape of thin rods. The rods are cut into pencil-length pieces, called leads, and sent along a conveyor belt to dry.STEP 5After drying, the pencil leads are put into an oven heated to 1,800 degrees F. The intense heat makes the leads smooth and hard, which makes for good writing points.STEP 6In another part of the factory, the wood is prepared. Machines cut blocks of Incense Cedar Wood, a renewable resource, into wide slats. Eight shallow grooves are sawed lengthwise into each slat.STEP 7A thin coat of glue is applied to the slats, and one pencil lead is placed into each of the eight grooves. Within seconds, another wide grooved slat is glued on top, sandwiching the leads.STEP 8When the glue dries, the slats are fed through a cutting machine. Fast revolving steel blades trim the wood into round or hexagonal shapes, one side at a time.STEP 9The same machine cuts apart each slat into eight separate pencils.STEP 10The pencils are sanded, and each one receives from five to eight coats of paint.STEP 11A heated metal stamp presses the name of the company and a number - such as a number 2 - on the pencil in foil or paint. The number indicates how hard the pencil lead is.STEP 12A metal band, called a ferrule, is wrapped tightly around one end of the pencil. It holds the eraser, which is being added here. The pencils are then ready to be sharpened, packaged, and used.",Manufacturing

Food processing is the transformation of raw ingredients, by physical or chemical means into food, or of food into other forms. Food processing combines raw food ingredients to produce marketable food products that can be easily prepared and served by the consumer. Food processing typically involves activities such as mincing and macerating, liquefaction, emulsification, and cooking (such as boiling, broiling, frying, or grilling); pickling, pasteurization, and many other kinds of preservation; and canning or other packaging. (Primary-processing such as dicing or slicing, freezing or drying when leading to secondary products are also included.)A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.Fast workers compilation 2017 god level really fast.Enjoy some of the fastest workers in the world ever.

1773,-8MPE74pq4w,Inside The Ice Cream Factory #part1| How To,"Inside The Ice Cream Factory #part1| How ToPlease Subscribe My Another Exciting YouTube Channel(Brain Teasers):-  https://bit.ly/2zDc1XnTo Subscribe YouTube Channel Click Here: https://goo.gl/hzhgHhPlease Don't Forget Like And Share.The Manufacturing Process:-Although ice cream is available in a variety of forms, including novelty items such as chocolate-dipped bars and sandwiches, the following description applies to ice cream that is packaged in pint and half-gallon containers.Blending the mixture:-1 The milk arrives at the ice cream plant in refrigerated tanker trucks from local dairy farms. The milk is then pumped into 5,000 gal (18,925 1) storage silos that are kept at 36¬∞F (2¬∞C). Pipes bring the milk in pre-measured amounts to 1,000 gal (3,7851) stainless steel blenders. Premeasured amounts of eggs, sugar, and additives are blended with the milk for six to eight minutes.Pasteurizing to kill bacteria:-2 The blended mixture is piped to the pasteurization machine, which is composed of Ice Cream of a series of thin stainless steel plates. Hot water, approximately 182¬∞F (83¬∞C), flows on one side of the plates. The cold milk mixture is piped through on the other side. The water warms the mixture to a temperature of 180¬∞F (82¬∞C), effectively killing any existing bacteria.Homogenizing to produce a uniform texture:-3 By the application of intensive air pressure, sometimes as much as 2,000 pounds per square inch (141 kg per sq cm), the hot mixture is forced through a small opening into the homogenizer. This breaks down the fat particles and prevents them from separating from the rest of the mixture. In the homogenizer, which is essentially a high-pressure piston pump, the mixture is further blended as it is drawn into the pump cylinder on the down stroke and then forced back out on the upstroke.Cooling and resting to blend flavors:-4 The mixture is piped back to the pasteurizer where cold water, approximately 34¬∞F (1¬∞C), flows on one side of the plates as the mixture passes on the opposite side. In this manner, the mixture is cooled to 36¬∞F (2¬∞ C). Then the mixture is pumped to 5,000 gal (18,925 1) tanks in a room set at 36¬∞F (2¬∞C), where it sits for four to eight hours to allow the ingredients to blend.Flavoring the ice cream:-5 The ice cream is pumped to stainless steel vats, each holding up to 300 gal (1,136 1) of the mixture. Flavorings are piped into the vats and blended thoroughly.Freezing to soft-serve consistency:-6 Now the mixture must be frozen. It is pumped into continuous freezers that  Ice Cream can freeze up to 700 gal (2,650 1) per hour. The temperature inside the freezers is kept at -40¬∞F(-40¬∞C), using liquid ammonia as a freezing agent. While the ice cream is in the freezer, air is injected into it. When the mixture leaves the freezer, it has the consistency of soft-serve ice cream.Adding fruit and sweetened chunks:-7 If chunks of food such as strawberry or cookie pieces are to be added to the ice cream, the frozen mixture is pumped to a fruit feeder. The chunks are loaded into a hopper at the top of the feeder. Another, smaller hopper, fitted with a starwheel, is located on the front of the feeder. An auger on the bottom of the machine turns the hoppers so that the chunks drop onto the starwheel in pre-measured amounts. As the mixture passes through the feeder, the starwheel pushes the food chunks into the ice cream. The mixture then moves to a blender where the chunks are evenly distributed.Packaging and bundling the finished product:-8 Automatic filling machines drop preprinted pint or half-gallon-sized cardboard cartons into holders. The cartons are then filled with premeasured amounts of ice cream at the rate of 70-90 cartons per hour. The machine then places a lid on each carton and pushes it onto a conveyer belt. The cartons move along the conveyer belt where they pass under an inkjet that spray-paints an expiration date and production code onto each carton. After the imprinting, the cartons move through the bundler, a heat tunnel that covers each cup with plastic shrink wrapping.Hardening:-9 Before storage and shipping, the ice cream must be hardened to a temperature of -10¬∞F (-23¬∞C). The conveyor system moves the ice cream cartons to a tunnel set at -30¬∞F (-34¬∞C). Constantly turning ceiling fans create a wind chill of -60¬∞F (-5 1¬∞C). The cartons move slowly back and forth through the tunnel for two to three hours until the contents are rock solid. The cartons are then stored in refrigerated warehouses until they are shipped to retail outlets.Quality Control:-Every mixture is randomly tested during the production process. Butterfat and solid levels are tested. The bacteria levels are measured. Each mixture is also taste-tested.Ice cream producers also carefully monitor the ingredients that they purchase from outside suppliers.",Manufacturing

1789,eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July ‚Äì 12 November 2017) https://www.vam.ac.uk/plywoodSponsored by MADE.COM.

1796,WeSOiKYmfOo,Shakar Sazi || Sugar Manufacturing,"A sugar cane mill can refer to a factory that processes sugar cane to produce raw or white sugar. It can also mean the piece of equipment that crushes the sticks of sugar cane to extract the juice.There are a number of steps in producing raw sugar from cane:Cane receiving and unloading (receive the cane at the factory and unload it from the transport vehicles)Cane preparation (cutting and shredding cane to prepare it for juice extraction)Juice extraction (two technologies are in common use; milling or diffusion)Juice clarification (remove suspended solids from the juice, typically mud, waxes, fibres)Juice evaporation (to concentrate the juice to a thick syrup of about 65¬∞brix)Syrup clarification (remove suspended solids from the syrup, typically colloid syze of mud, waxes, fibres, etc.)CrystallisationCentrifugation (Separation of the sugar crystals from the mother liquor, done by centrifugal machines)Sugar dryingPackaging and deliveryThese processing steps will produce a brown or raw sugar. Mill white sugar also known as plantation white sugar can be produced by introducing some form of colour removal process (often sulphitation) between the juice clarification and the juice evaporation stages mentioned above.The raw sugar produced is often refined to produce white sugar. This sugar refining can be done either at a completely separate factory or at a back-end refinery which is attached to the raw sugar factory.For Feedback : muslimtvpak@gmail.comFollow us on twitter || https://goo.gl/UjsfLtLike our page on Facebook || https://www.facebook.com/MTAPakistan/",Manufacturing

It consists of a frame, permanent magnet, soft iron core, voice coil, and cone. The frame supports the cone and permanent magnet assembly. The voice coil consists of an insulated wire wound around a plastic bobbin. One end of the bobbin is attached to the cone and the body of the bobbin slides over the soft iron core.The wires from the voice coil are connected to an audio amplifier. When electrical audio signals from the amplifier are applied to the voice coil, an electromagnetic field is produced around the voice coil. This causes the voice coil to move back and forth along the soft iron core which aids or opposes the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnet. The movement of the voice coil causes the attached cone to vibrate and produce sound.There are four major types of speakers: full-range, tweeter, midrange, and woofer. The full-range speaker can reproduce most of the audio sound spectrum. However, a single speaker cannot accurately reproduce the entire audio frequency range of the human ear. Therefore, other speakers were designed to overcome the limitations of the full-range speaker.The tweeter is designed for the higher audio frequencies or treble sounds in the 4-20 kHz range. They are very small, usually around 2 in (5.1 cm) in diameter or under. The midrange speaker reproduces sounds in the 1,000 Hz to 10 kHz frequency range. Their size ranges from 2 into 8 in (5.1‚Äî20.3 cm) in diameter. The woofer reproduces the bass or very low sounds in the 20-1,000 Hz frequency range. A subwoofer can extend this to as low as 3 Hz. Woofers range from 4 into 15 in (10.2-38.1 cm) in diameter with 10-12 in (25.4-30.2 cm) in diameter being the most common.Akio Morita was born January 26, 1921, in the Japanese village of Kosugaya. Morita would have been the fifteenth generation heir to his family's 300-year-old sake business, but instead entered the prestigious Eighth Higher School as a physics major.Read more: http://www.madehow.com/Volume-7/Stere...The Manufacturing Process:-1. The permanent magnet is constructed by mixing iron oxide with strontium and then milling the compound into a very fine power. The power is mixed with a ceramic binder and then closed in a metal die. The die is then placed in a furnace and sintered to bond the mixture together.2. The frame is constructed from an aluminum or steel sheet. The sheet arrives at the plant preformed. It is then placed on a conveyor belt and transported to a cutting machine that used a hydraulic press to cut holes in the sheet to allow free air movement from the cone. The sheet is then formed by a hydraulic press that forces the sheet into a die of the desired shape. Mounting holes are then drilled at their proper locations.3. The cone, surround, and the spider is individually formed out of composite paper and then glued together as an assembly.4. The voice coil is built by winding many turns of very fine insulated copper wire on a plastic bobbin. The bobbin and voice coil assembly is glued to the dust cap of the cone assembly.5. The frame, soft iron core, and permanent magnet are bolted together as an assembly.6. The cone assembly is then attached to the frame assembly by first manually gluing the spider to the base of the frame and then gluing the surround to the top of the frame.Quality Control:-Inspectors monitor all steps of the manufacturing process. The permanent magnet is checked for chips or cracks. The paper cones are inspected for flaws or holes in the material, and proper gluing of the cone assembly. The entire assembly is inspected for overall quality and adherence to specifications.The final speaker assembly is connected to an audio generator that tests the frequency response and power capabilities of the speaker to ensure that it produces sound within the required specifications.Byproducts/Waste:-Scrap metal from the frame and scrap paper from the cone are sent to recycling plants for reclamation. Exotic materials such as strontium must be disposed of according to government regulations.The Future:-The industry is constantly experimenting with raw materials to improve speaker sound quality, frequency response, and power output. New technologies are being developed in the form of a direct-drive speaker that uses no cone.",Manufacturing

Disposable Nappies/Diapers Manufacturing BusinessDisposable diapers are a great convenience in the modern world. A disposable diaper consists of an absorbent pad sandwiched between two sheets of nonwoven fabric. The pad is specially designed to absorb and retain body fluids, and the nonwoven fabric gives the diaper a comfortable shape and helps prevent leakage. These diapers are made by a multi-step process in which the absorbent pad is first vacuum-formed, then attached to a permeable top sheet and impermeable bottom sheet. The components are sealed together by application of heat or ultrasonic vibrations. Elastic fibers are attached to the sheets to gather the edges of the diaper into the proper shape so it fits snugly around a baby's legs and crotch. When properly fitted, the disposable diaper will retain body fluids which pass through the permeable top sheet and are absorbed into the pad.See morehttps://goo.gl/h938Ub https://goo.gl/jHxmzW https://goo.gl/pruXER https://goo.gl/KhnC8rContact us: Niir Project Consultancy ServicesAn ISO 9001:2015 Company106-E, Kamla Nagar, Opp. Spark Mall,New Delhi-110007, India.Email: npcs.ei@gmail.com  , info@entrepreneurindia.co Tel: +91-11-23843955, 23845654, 23845886, 8800733955Mobile: +91-9811043595Website: www.entrepreneurindia.co  , www.niir.orgTagsBaby Diaper Production, Disposable Baby Diaper Production, How Disposable Nappies/Diapers are Made?, Diaper (Nappy) Manufacturing, How Disposable Diaper is Made, Diaper Manufacturing Business Plan, Baby Diaper Manufacturing Machine, Disposable Diapers, Manufacturing Process of Disposable Diaper, Disposable Diaper Manufacturing, Baby Disposable Diapers, Diaper Production Cost, Manufacturing of Baby Diapers, Diaper Manufacturing Process, Diaper Manufacturing Business, How to Make Disposable Diapers, Baby Diaper Manufacturing Business Plan, Project Report on Baby Diapers Manufacturing Unit, Baby Diaper Making Plant, What is Baby Diapers Manufacturing Industry, Baby Diaper Production, Disposable Baby Diaper Manufacture, Disposable Diaper Manufacturing Unit, Baby Diaper Manufacturing Plant, How to Start Diaper Manufacturing Company, Start Diaper Manufacturing Business, How to Set Up Disposable Diaper Manufacturing Business, Project Report on Baby Diapers Manufacturing Unit, Diapers Manufacturing in India, Disposable Diaper Manufacturing project ideas, Projects on Small Scale Industries, Small scale industries projects ideas, Disposable Diaper Manufacturing Based Small Scale Industries Projects, Project profile on small scale industries, How to Start Disposable Diaper Manufacturing Industry in India, Disposable Diaper Manufacturing Projects, New project profile on Disposable Baby Diaper Production industries, Project Report on Disposable Diaper Manufacturing Industry, Detailed Project Report on Disposable Baby Diaper Production, Project Report on Disposable Baby Diaper Production, Pre-Investment Feasibility Study on Disposable Baby Diaper Production, Techno-Economic feasibility study on Disposable Diaper Manufacturing, Feasibility report on Disposable Diaper Manufacturing, Free Project Profile on Disposable Diaper Manufacturing, Project profile on Disposable Baby Diaper Production, Download free project profile on Disposable Baby Diaper Production, Industrial Project Report, Project consultant, Startup Project for Disposable Diaper Manufacturing",Manufacturing

1850,subeIZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,"In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. Step 1: T-Shirt Design The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.Step 2: Pattern MakingOnce the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. Step 3: Sample CuttingOnce the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. Step 4: Sewing The T-ShirtAfter the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. Step 5: Mass Production CuttingAs soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. Step 6: Mass Production Sewing Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line DistributionThe last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

1854,tVeQQCNiQ8Q,Audi Cars Manufacturing Process,"Audi Cars Manufacturing ProcessAudi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data ‚Äì the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data ‚Äì will facilitate data‚Äëdriven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future ‚Äì from the application of virtual‚Äëreality glasses to metal 3D printing.Modular assembly.The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines ‚Äì in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems ‚Äì it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Gy≈ër, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by ‚Äúarculus‚Äù ‚Äì a startup company established a few months ago.The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnology Development Production Assistance Systems‚Äù department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‚Äësoftware development processes.The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.The Audi Production Lab.The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‚ÄëLab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process ‚Äì often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‚Äërobot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.The projects currently running in the P‚ÄëLab include two big‚Äëdata projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future ‚Äì with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.Toolmaking.Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi‚Äôs Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‚Äëmetal parts.The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‚Äëmetal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

Production of Stick Electrodes, Welding Rods, Weld Rods.An electrode is a metal wire that is coated. It is made out of materials with a similar composition to the metal being welded. Welding electrodes are installed in the weld head to touch and maintain contact with the work pieces through the full weld schedule. The welding electrodes play three different roles in resistance welding: maintaining uniform current density, concentrating current at welding points, and maintaining thermal balance during welding.Welding electrodes are used for Arc welding purposes. The electrode is coated with the flux. Although electrodes are produced in different gauges, for the purpose of calculation for financial implications of technical details, the assumption has been made for the production of electrodes of 4mm diacore rods. The electrodes are used for fabrication work for joining the steel, alloy steel and cast iron parts for hard facing of jobs etc.See morehttps://goo.gl/7AT2Zc https://goo.gl/vNAt1D Contact us: Niir Project Consultancy ServicesAn ISO 9001:2015 Company106-E, Kamla Nagar, Opp. Spark Mall,New Delhi-110007, India.Email: npcs.ei@gmail.com  , info@entrepreneurindia.co Tel: +91-11-23843955, 23845654, 23845886, 8800733955Mobile: +91-9811043595Website: www.entrepreneurindia.co  , www.niir.orgTagsWelding Electrode Manufacturing Plant, Welding Electrode Manufacturing Process, Project Profile on Welding Electrode Manufacturing, Welding Electrode Making Business, Welding Electrode Plant, Welding Electrode Manufacturing Unit, Production of Welding Electrodes, Welding Electrode Manufacturing Company, Production of Electrodes, Welding Electrode Manufacturing Machinery, Manufacturing of Welding Electrode, Production of Welding Electrodes, Project Report on Welding Electrodes Production, Welding Electrode Production Plant, Business Plan for Manufacturing of Welding Electrode, Electrode Production, Welding Electrode Making Factory, Electrode Manufacturing Process, Manufacture of Welding Electrode, How to Start Welding Rods Manufacturing Business, How to Start Welding Business, Welding Electrode Manufacturing Plant Cost, Electrode Making Plant, Starting Welding Business, Welding Industry in India, Welding Electrode Manufacture, Electrode Manufacturing project ideas, Projects on Small Scale Industries, Small scale industries projects ideas, Welding Electrodes Production Based Small Scale Industries Projects, Project profile on small scale industries, How to Start Electrode Manufacturing Industry in India, Stick Electrodes Production, Manufacturing of Stick Electrodes, Stick Electrodes Manufacturing industry, How to Start Stick Electrodes Manufacturing Business, Weld Rods Production, Manufacturing Plant of Weld Rods, How to Start Weld Rods Manufacturing Industry, Production of Weld Rods, How to Manufacture of Weld Rods?

C&EN Senior Correspondent Jean-Fran√ßois Tremblay went inside Cipla's advanced pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing plant to learn more about the stringent regulations it must follow. India's future as the world's drugstore is a controversial topic. Other drugmakers have been heavily fined, or had products recalled or banned, because of problems at plants.

Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",Manufacturing

It would also contain water, sugar, vinegar, salt, and seasoning. ... Tomato ketchup is a condiment manufactured with similar ingredients, although paste is used rather than whole tomatoes.Application ReportsManufacture of Tomato Sauces and KetchupsTomato sauces are used in many products including frozen foods, pasta sauces and pizza toppings, etc. A typical tomato sauce would be based on sieved or whole tomatoes, and/or tomato paste. It would also contain water, sugar, vinegar, salt and seasoning. The desired product viscosity would normally be achieved using a starch-based thickener.Tomato ketchup is a condiment manufactured from similar ingredients, although paste is used rather than whole tomatoes. Premium quality ketchups with a high solids content derive their viscosity from a combination of water retention of the fibrous strands in the paste and the gelling effect of pectin found naturally in tomatoes. High-pressure homogenization is also used to obtain the desired viscosity. This is common with lower solids content ketchup, which may also contain starch-based thickeners.The Process:-The recipe, viscosity and solids content of sauces and ketchup vary widely according to the end user. Typical process requirements are as follows:-Mixing apparatus must be capable of dispersing powdered ingredients into the water to form an agglomerate-free product.-If the product is made from whole peeled tomatoes, these require chopping and pulping before addition to the mix.-Insoluble particles in the tomatoes need to be fully dispersed and ‚Äúmilled‚Äù to obtain a smooth texture and even dispersion of the pigment (carotin) to give depth of color.-Fibrous strands in the tomatoes must be fibrillated (frayed) to raise capacity for water retention, which increases viscosity.-Once mixed, the product may be passed through a high-pressure homogenizer or colloid mill to obtain the required consistency.The Advantages:--Dramatically reduced processing times-Rapid dispersion of thickeners and stabilizers-Improved yield of ingredients-Smoother texture and improved product consistency-Improved color -The product fed to the homogenizer is uniform and of low particle size, allowing faster processing through the homogenizer and fewer passes required-Some sauces with low solids content may not require homogenization-Special ""low shear"" head available for processing whole tomatoes to eliminate risk of milling pips-A Silverson mixer can be used as a ""polishing step"" after homogenization to improve texture, viscosity, and sheen to ketchup",Manufacturing

Heavy Rare Earth Element mining is impeded. Energy sector innovation is stifled. Thorium is less dangerous, less radioactive, and less easily metabolized than many elements we are exposed to on a daily basis.Current regulation assists China's capture of high-tech manufacturing sector. Current regulation protects incumbent U.S. [light] rare earth producers who DISPOSE of thorium and valuable heavy rare earths in tailing ponds. Current regulation does NOT facilitate growth of U.S. economy.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle recognize reform is needed. No one is willing to introduce legislation to address the thorium problem. China continues to capture high-tech manufacturing jobs.

2002,ZK9cJt3C_I8,What is Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?,"Let‚Äôs tune as our President and CEO Scott Whitlock explains how MES is all about flows within manufacturing ‚Äì planning flows, execution flows and monitoring flows.Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are known by many names: data collection solutions, shop floor execution systems, and manufacturing operations management (MOM).Manufacturing Execution Systems collect multiple plants‚Äô production information, and integrate easily with equipment, controllers and enterprise business applications. Although MES solutions are used to operate as a self-contained system, they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The result is complete visibility, control and manufacturing optimization ‚Äì from order placing, production inception, and process control to product output.------Flexware Innovation, Inc. began in 1996 with a passion for helping manufacturers harness the power of MES and realize the strategic benefits of improved yields, lower operating costs and overall leaner manufacturing. And it‚Äôs still a passion for our FlexDogs today, as we help manufacturers across the U.S. implement MES within their operations. It‚Äôs one of the things we love most. Well that, and IoT technology within the manufacturing arena, but that‚Äôs a blog for another day.------To learn more about Flexware Innovation and how they help manufacturer's with their MES systems, please visit http://www.flexwareinnovation.com/To download our eBook ""5 Risks of Sticking with a Legacy MES"", visit http://flexwareinnovation.com/ebook/",Manufacturing

Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.Fishbowl's Whiteboard Wednesday videos break down important inventory management topics in a couple of minutes.

2051,Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,"Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.Improved Time ManagementOperators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!Increasing Operator ProductivityAn example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.Improved MotivationStaff motivation can be improved in two ways.Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",Manufacturing

Lube Oil Blending and Filling PlantLubrication is simply the use of a material to improve the smoothness if movement of one surface over another; the material which is used in this way is called a lubricant. Lubricants are usually liquids or semi-liquids, but may be solids or gases or any combination of solids, liquids, and gases.Lubricant is a substance which is used to control (more often to reduce) friction and wear of the surfaces in a contact of the bodies in relative motion. Depending on its nature, lubricants are also used to eliminate heat and wear debris, supply additives into the contact, transmit power, protect, seal. A lubricant can be in liquid (oil, water, etc.), solid (graphite, graphene, and molybdenum disulfide), gaseous (air) or even semisolid (grease) forms. Most of the lubricants contain additives (5-30%) to improve their performance.See morehttps://goo.gl/Z6dFQy https://goo.gl/aJipu1 https://goo.gl/abYHtd Contact us: Niir Project Consultancy ServicesAn ISO 9001:2015 Company106-E, Kamla Nagar, Opp. Spark Mall,New Delhi-110007, India.Email: npcs.ei@gmail.com  , info@entrepreneurindia.co Tel: +91-11-23843955, 23845654, 23845886, 8800733955Mobile: +91-9811043595Website: www.entrepreneurindia.co  , www.niir.orgTagsLube Oil Blending Plant, Lubricants Blending Plant (Lubricants/Grease), Grease & Lube Oil Blending Plant, Lubricants Blending Process,  Lubricants and Greases Manufacturing Plant, Lubricants and Greases, Blending Plant, Lubricant and Grease Blending Company, Project Report on Grease Manufacturing, Grease Manufacturing Unit, Industrial Oils and Greases‚Äé Blending Plant, Lube Oil Blending Plant and Filling Line, Lubricating Oil Blending Plant and Production Line, Lube Oil Filling Plant, Oil Blending Plant, How Lubricating Oil is Made, Lube Oil Blending, Lubricants & Greases Manufacturing Plant, Lube Blending Plant, Pre-Feasibility Report on Small Scale Lube Oil Blending Plant, Lubricant Blending Process, Process for Making Blended Lubricant, How are Lubricants Produced, Lubricant Blending, Manufacturing of Lubricant Oil, Lubricating Oils and Greases, Lube & Grease Oil Blending Plant and Filling Plant, Manufacture of Oils and Greases, Grease Blending Plant, How to Start Grease Blending Company, Grease Plant, Grease Manufacturing Plant, Blending Plant in India, Grease Manufacturing Plant, Lubricating Oil and Grease Manufacturing, Grease Manufacturing Project Report, Lubricant Blending project ideas, Projects on Small Scale Industries, Small scale industries projects ideas, Lube Oil Blending Based Small Scale Industries Projects, Project profile on small scale industries, How to Start Lubricating Oil Blending Plant Industry in India, Lubricating Oil Blending Projects, New project profile on Lubricant and Grease Blending industries, Project Report on Lube Oil Blending Industry, Detailed Project Report on Lube Oil Blending, Project Report on Lubricant and Grease Blending Plant, Pre-Investment Feasibility Study on Lubricating Oil Blending Plant, Techno-Economic feasibility study on Lubricating Oil Blending Plant, Feasibility report on Lubricant and Grease Blending Plant, Free Project Profile on Lube Oil Blending, Project profile on Lube Oil Blending, Download free project profile on Lube Oil Blending, Industrial Project Startup Project for Lubricant Blending Process",Manufacturing

2086,J4qwK1KgL_s,Philippines: Cebu Province: Illegal Gun-Manufacturing Centre - 1997,"Cebu province in the Philippines is known for its beautiful beaches and resorts.But Cebu is known to Filipinos for its illegal gun-manufacturing centred in the city of  Danao.Recently, the government has approved licences for two gun manufacturing companies  in Danao.But some remain in operation even without a permit, and this is likely to continue.UPSOUND: (Sound of rapid gunfire from Uzi-gram)Byron Garcia is testing what he calls an ""uzi-gram"".It's one of the products being manufactured by the Danao Arms Manufacturing  Corporation, or Damcor - the first licensed gun manufacturer in Danao City.The city of Danao, in the Philippine central island of Cebu, has always been notorious  as the centre of illegal gun manufacturing.Here, thousands of residents have been involved for decades in what is virtually  considered a cottage industry, making home-made guns, popularly known as ""paltik"".By establishing Damcor, Garcia has legalised gun manufacturing in Danao. Damcor specialises on the 38-revolver, and is also producing machine pistols and  shotguns mainly to supply the country's security agencies.Garcia has invested more than 40 (m) million pesos in Damcor, some of which were  spent on machines with state of the art  technology to produce some of the gun parts.But most of the work is left for the 70 workers that Garcia has employed since his  company opened last year.Most of their experience is based on what they've been clandestinely doing in their  backyard for years.30-year old Lito Gonzales was into illegal gun making for ten years before he decided to  work for Damcor.  Here, he earns about 600-dollars a month, and is free from the anxiety of being arrested  by the authorities.SOUNDBITE: (Tagalog) ""Now, we're okay here, because we don't need to worry about being arrested today or  tomorrow, that the police will arrest us because it's illegal to do guns outside. No  more.""SUPER CAPTION:  Lito Gonzales, worker Danao Arms Manufacturing CorporationBut despite the entry of Damcor and another licensed gun company, Garcia believes  that the illegal gun- manufacturing industry in Danao will continue to flourish, mainly  because of the lack of political will to remove it.SOUNDBITE:  (English) ""Maybe it will change a bit. But it cannot totally eradicate the illegal business here.""SUPER CAPTION:  Byron Garcia, President Danao Arms Manufacturing CorporationAnd for most of the illegal gun makers in this city, making the ""paltik"" in their  backyards will surely be a hard habit to break.For 20-year-old Julius Capuyan, it's the only job he's known since he was 13 years old.SOUNDBITE:  (Tagalog) ""There's no other way of life for us here. We'd rather live this way, illegally making guns.SUPER CAPTION:  Julius CapuyanMost of the people in Danao have relied on this illegal industry as their livelihood for  decades making the government's job of curbing the unlicensed gun-manufacturing  operations a difficult task.You can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...

2094,pf-tQYcZGM4,üì∫ Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post,"There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.In that way, the book continues to resonate.But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""Aman Sethi put it like this:""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""More from The Listening Post on:YouTube - http://aje.io/listeningpostYTFacebook - http://facebook.com/AJListeningPostTwitter - http://twitter.com/AJListeningPostWebsite - http://aljazeera.com/listeningpost- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",Manufacturing

2138,yVeLsJtId_g,MANUFACTURE OF THE BOFORS 40mm ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN AT CHRYSLER  BOFORS GUN TEAM 58844,"Support Our Channel : https://www.patreon.com/PeriscopeFilmMade as part of the WWII war effort by Chrysler, THE BOFORS GUN TEAM shows the manufacture of the Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun then in use by the Navy and Army. This was one of the most stunning manufacturing feats of the war, since the Bofors was an extremely intimidating weapon to mass produce and many believed it could not be produced in quantity, in time to make a difference in the war. Within 3 years however Chrysler had shipped over 40,000 complete mechanisms and 75,000 barrels. At 1:55, the Swedish-designed gun is seen in its ""Americanized"" configuration -- made for mass production in a Chrysler factory. At 2:30, new blueprints are made from Swedish originals which were in metric measure. At 2:45, a diagram shows how the manufacture of the gun was split between Dodge, DeSoto, Plymouth and other Chrysler plants. Production lines are seen for breech casings and other parts in the gigantic plants, which were formerly used for automobile manufacture. At 8:55, blocks are shown being made through mass production techniques. At 9:11, quality inspection is made of the blocks. At 13:30, the manufacture of the gun barrel is seen. At 16:20, breech blocks are assembled and tested. The Bofors 40 mm gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun,is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. A small number of these weapons remain in service to this day, and saw action as late as the Gulf War.In the post-war era the original design was not suitable for action against jet powered aircraft, so Bofors introduced a new model of significantly more power, the 40 mm L/70. In spite of sharing almost nothing with the original design other than the calibre and the distinctive conical flash hider, this weapon is also widely known simply as ""the Bofors"". Although not as popular as the original L/60 model, the L/70 remains in service, especially as a multi-purpose weapon for light armored vehicles, as on the CV 90.  In order to supply both the Army and Navy with much greater numbers of the guns, Chrysler built 60,000 of the guns and 120,000 barrels through the war, at half the original projected cost, and filling the Army's needs by 1943. Over the lifetime of the production, their engineers introduced numerous additional changes to improve mass production, eventually reducing the overall time needed to build a gun by half; most of these changes were in production methods rather than the design of the gun itself.York Safe & Lock also produced the weapons, though its attempts to coordinate drawings across the program were unsuccessful, and this responsibility was transferred to the Naval Gun Factory in July 1943.There were many difficulties in producing the guns within the United States, beyond their complexity (illustrated by the use of 2,000 subcontractors in 330 cities and 12 Chrysler factories to make and assemble the parts).

Germany is Europe's biggest consumer. For manufacturing Technetium-99m, Molybdenum-99 is required at first. However, this can be produced internationally in only a few research reactors, and this has caused shortages for many years. That is why the Research Neutron Source Heinz Maier-Leibnitz of the Technical University of Munich is currently being upgraded to supply half of the European need of this important diagnostic tool for cardiac and thyroid function or cancer. The film presents the state of the project and the technical challenges, the manufacturing process of Technetium-99m and its application in medicine.--Learn more about the Research Neutron Source Heinz Maier-Leibnitz (FRM II): https://www.frm2.tum.de/en",Manufacturing

Lithographic Inks, Gravure Inks, Flexographic Inks, Offset Inks and Specialty Printing Inks, Inkjet Inks, Toner Inks, Copier Inks, Marking Ink, Colour Ink, Water Proof Inks, Writing Inks, indelible ink, Election InksPrinting inks, refer to a liquid or paste, are widely used to color surfaces such as newspaper, books and magazines, cardboard and ceramic tiles to produce an image, text or design. Printing Inks contain pigments or dyes that are mixed with oil, solvents or water that forms liquid or paste. It can be widely used in coloring surfaces such as newspaper, books and magazines, cardboard and ceramic tiles.India is among the fast growing printing ink markets globally spurred by the rapid expansion of the domestic print markets. Backed by a strong demand from key end user segments such as package printing, newsprint, publishing and other commercial printing, the printing ink market in India has registered strong growth in the recent years. The printing ink industry is fragmented with over 400 manufacturers and a large number of players in the unorganised sector.Global printing inks market growth is attributable to increasing adoption of printing inks made of vegetable oil-based solvents, as these oils eliminate the use of mineral oils in inks. One of the prime drivers for the global printing inks market is the rising demand from the packaging sector.See morehttps://goo.gl/oN41gehttps://goo.gl/DHt3bV https://goo.gl/B22nrp Contact us: Niir Project Consultancy ServicesAn ISO 9001:2015 Company106-E, Kamla Nagar, Opp. Spark Mall,New Delhi-110007, India.Email: npcs.ei@gmail.com  , info@entrepreneurindia.co Tel: +91-11-23843955, 23845654, 23845886, 8800733955Mobile: +91-9811043595Website: www.entrepreneurindia.co  , www.niir.orgTagsInk Manufacturing, Manufacturing of Printing Inks with Formulation, Printing Ink Making Business, Printing Ink Manufacturing Business, Printing Ink Formulation, How Ink is Manufactured?

2159,YkO52UqWyEs,How Political Power Uses Propaganda to Distract the Public: Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing Consent,"Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is a 1989 book by US academic Noam Chomsky concerning political power using propaganda to distort and distract from major issues to maintain confusion and complicity, preventing real democracy from becoming effective. The title of this book borrows a phrase from the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr.Nearly the entire first half of the book is based on Chomsky's five 1988 Massey Lectures on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio from November 1988 and extends his and Edward S. Herman's propaganda model to a variety of new situations. The remaining appendices address criticisms of the work and provide additional detail.As a genre of political thought, parallels exist between Niebuhr's ""necessary illusions"" and the ""noble lies"" of Leo Strauss, ""public relations"" of Edward Bernays and ""myth making"" of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. Likewise, Chomsky's analyses in Necessary Illusions represent a refocus on the use of these patterns of power, which he implies to underscore the failure of populations - particularly in a representative democracy - to learn from history in this regard.Contents     Democracy and the Media     Containing the Enemy     The Bounds of the Expressible     Adjuncts of Government     The Utility of InterpretationsAppendix I     The Propaganda Model: Some Methodological Considerations     On Critical BalanceAppendix II     The Containment Doctrine     The Red ScareAppendix III     The Sanctity of BordersAppendix IV     The Craft of ""Historical Engineering""     The Obligation of Silence     The Summits     The Media and International Opinion     Demolishing the AccordsAppendix V     The US and Costa Rican Democracy     ""The Evil Scourge of Terrorism""     Hereos and Devils     The ""Peace Process"" in the Middle East     The Best Defense     La Prensa and its Colleagues     ""The Courage to Preserve Civil Liberties""     The Continuing StruggleSee also     John Taylor Gatto The Underground History of American Education     Adam Curtis Century of the Selfhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessar...",Manufacturing

Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing Project. Mosquito Coil Composition. Mosquito Repellent IndustryA mosquito coil essentially is an incense like the ones that are used in aromatherapy as well as in different religious rituals only this one is used for repelling mosquitoes. Mosquito coils are burned indoors and outdoors in regions like Asia, Africa, and South America. Mosquito coils consist of an insecticide/repellant, organic fillers capable of burning with smoldering, binder, and additives such as synergists, dyes, and fungicide.Mosquitoes need to be exterminated using with right tools and little bit of effort. Mosquito coil is mosquito-repelling incense, usually shaped into a spiral, and typically made from a dried paste of pyrethrum powder. The coil is usually held at the center of the spiral, suspending it in the air, or wedged by two pieces of fireproof nettings to allow continuous smoldering. Burning usually begins at the outer end of the spiral and progresses slowly toward the centre of the spiral, producing a mosquito-repellent smoke.See morehttps://goo.gl/6euxCMhttps://goo.gl/a5ThmW Contact us: Niir Project Consultancy ServicesAn ISO 9001:2015 Company106-E, Kamla Nagar, Opp. Spark Mall,New Delhi-110007, India.Email: npcs.ei@gmail.com  , info@entrepreneurindia.co Tel: +91-11-23843955, 23845654, 23845886, 8800733955Mobile: +91-9811043595Website: www.entrepreneurindia.co  , www.niir.orgTagsProduction of Mosquitoes Repellants Coils, Mosquito Coil and Process for Producing, How Mosquito Repellent is Made, Process for Manufacture of Mosquito Coil, How to Make Mosquito Coil, Mosquito Coil Making Formula, Mosquito Coil Composition and Process, Mosquito Coil Making Process, Mosquito Coil Making Raw Material, Mosquito Coil Ingredients, Production of Mosquito Coil, Mosquito Coil Making Machine, Production of Mosquito Repellent, Mosquito Coil Making Plant, Mosquito Coil Making Unit, Mosquito Coil Production, Mosquito Coils Manufacture, Production of Mosquito Repellants Insecticides (Mosquito Coil), How to Make Mosquito Repelling Incense, Mosquito Coil Making Factory, Mosquito Repellent Formulations,  Mosquito Coils Factory, Mosquito Coil Making Business in India, Mosquito Coils Manufacture, Mosquito Coil Manufacturing Unit, Mosquito Coil Production Plant, Mosquito Coil Making Business, Mosquito Coil Manufacturing company, Project Report on Mosquito Repellent Coils,  Mosquito Coil Making project ideas, Projects on Small Scale Industries, Small scale industries projects ideas, Mosquito Coil Composition Based Small Scale Industries Projects, Project profile on small scale industries, How to Start Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing Industry in India, Mosquito Coil Composition Projects, New project profile on Mosquito Coil Making industries, Project Report on Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing Industry, Detailed Project Report on Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing, Project Report on Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing, Pre-Investment Feasibility Study on Mosquito Coil Composition, Techno-Economic feasibility study on Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing, Feasibility report on Mosquito Coil Composition, Free Project Profile on Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing, Project profile on Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing, Download free project profile on Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing, Industrial Project Report,  Project consultant, Project consultancy, Startup Project for Mosquito Repelling Incense Coils Manufacturing",Manufacturing

2209,B8Pkp7OhwPg,"Lean Manufacturing: Cycle Time Analysis, Variance Tracking & Eliminating Work Stoppages","http://www.driveyoursuccess.com The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

2212,atyr_88nQDg,Perfumery Compounds Manufacturing and Formulation. Agarbatti Perfumery Compounds. Fragrance Oil.,"Y_463A perfume may be defined as any mixture of pleasantly odorous substances. Originally all the products used in perfumery were of natural origin. The finest modern perfumes are neither wholly synthetic nor yet completely natural. The demand is increasing day by day due to increase in the standard of living. The demand will further increase as there is good export potential as well local consumption.  Perfumes occupy an important place in modern life style. Apart from cosmetic and toiletry products perfumes are used in many products to mask odor and improve appeal. A perfumery compound is not a single material of clearly defined properties, but rather a mixture of individual chemicals, each behaving according to its own unique attributes. Characterizing these chemicals separately, and then combining their effects, allows the behavior of the complete perfume composition in diverse media to be understood. Important properties of fragrance chemicals include volatility, polarity, surface activity and stability. Considering the fact that perfume raw materials are themselves quite often complex mixtures of synthetic or natural (e.g. essential oils) organic compounds, the determination of the composition of an unknown perfume, the so called perfume-formulation process, is not an easy task.

The video is about Germany Worm Gears Manufacture - Discover Heavyweight Production |  Technology Connections. If there is any copyright strike, please contact me via dotuanvu237@gmail.comI will fully follow the copyright owner decision!A worm drive is a gear arrangement in which a worm (which is a gear in the form of a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and worm wheel. The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term worm gear to refer to the worm, the worm gear, or the worm drive as a unit.Like other gear arrangements, a worm drive can reduce rotational speed or transmit higher torque. A worm is an example of a screw, one of the six simple machines.One of the major advantages of worm gear drive units are that they can transfer motion in 90 degrees.A gearbox designed using a worm and worm-wheel is considerably smaller than one made from plain spur gears, and has its drive axes at 90¬∞ to each other. With a single start worm, for each 360¬∞ turn of the worm, the worm-wheel advances only one tooth of the gear wheel. Therefore, regardless of the worm's size (sensible engineering limits notwithstanding), the gear ratio is the ""size of the worm wheel - to - 1"". Given a single start worm, a 20 tooth worm wheel reduces the speed by the ratio of 20:1. With spur gears, a gear of 12 teeth must match with a 240 tooth gear to achieve the same 20:1 ratio. Therefore, if the diametrical pitch (DP) of each gear is the same, then, in terms of the physical size of the 240 tooth gear to that of the 20 tooth gear, the worm arrangement is considerably smaller in volume.There are three different types of gears that can be used in a worm drive.The first are non-throated worm gears. These don't have a throat, or groove, machined around the circumference of either the worm or worm wheel. The second are single-throated worm gears, in which the worm wheel is throated. The final type are double-throated worm gears, which have both gears throated. This type of gearing can support the highest loading.[1]An enveloping (hourglass) worm has one or more teeth and increases in diameter from its middle portion toward both ends.[2]Double-enveloping wormgearing comprises enveloping worms mated with fully enveloping wormgears. It is also known as globoidal wormgearing. technology information technology news technology in education technology future technology innovation technology solutions bearing machinery cnc",Manufacturing

Two and a half years ago we watched the technician re-enter data from one system to the next system for the next system.  It was so disempowering. They were very frustrated that the systems weren't integrated.  We needed a solution that could really scale with us.The way we operate the business the way people learn is different. And, we have to be ready for that.Our vision is that each operation team has a tool in their handto improve their business results.Out on the lines on to tablets so they can interact with the data real time at the point that they need to not over back over the desk. Because the work doesn't happen at the desk. Work happens at the piece of equipment.From our team rooms we went away from you know hard writtenpaper or single desk typing to touchscreen technology so they can get there and drag new data around. It blew me away.One of the primary benefit is the flexibility you get in a platform solution. In terms of time savings, energy savings, we're going to at least see 45-minute pressure per line per business unit.It has the flexibility to look at the same data in different ways that make sense for that particular operational team at that particular time.The KPIs from that digital platform really help us visualize the operational level. Including process reliability which is really efficiency of the operations, safety and quality.Too often we provide a solution that is limited.I'm very confident in GE's ability to expand this outside the factory walls to look at the entire supply chain.

2269,5s0J-7W4i6s,Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing,"The patented Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) process uses the power of sound to merge layers of metal foil. The process produces true metallurgical bonds with full density and works with a variety of metals such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and titanium. In combining additive and subtractive process capabilities, UAM can create deep slots, hollow, latticed, or honeycombed internal structures, and other complex geometries impossible with conventional subtractive manufacturing processes.  Additionally, the solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for welding of dissimilar metals.  This enables dissimilar metal cladding, production of custom metal matrix composites, and the ability to embed objects or sensors in a metal substrate.   Through the use of UAM technology, customers will be able to manufacture complex parts that have unique features and attributes not possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. In addition, parts currently made with traditional operations can be made with much less waste, an increasingly important factor as more expensive, higher performance materials see broader use.",Manufacturing

2323,04uKmaKa8DU,Manufacturing Predictions - The future of the manufacturing industry (ISCF - Clean Growth),"What will the future of manufacturing be like?Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.Anything, anywhereIn the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but it‚Äôs not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.Subscribe to our YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Innovate...Find out about our other predictions, including healthcare and cities, here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Click here to find out our essential tips for small businesses: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...",Manufacturing

2341,vEJGSfvM2I8,"Manufacturer Price Sheet: Material, Labor, Overhead & Profit","The following video breaks down how a manufacturer should come up with a price for industrial finished goods. First, the company must account for its material costs and apply a 5 percent indirect cost to that portion of the manufacturer's price sheet.This 5 percent is meant to offset overruns in production and or additional costs of financing inventory and material purchases.Second, the company must account for its labor relative to each operation performed to turn a raw material into a finished good. The calculation involves defining the operation and applying the labor cost to both the setup time in manufacturing and the actual run time. Third, all labor costs are added in order to come up with a complete total for all the costs of manufacturing a given product. Those costs are then followed up by the company's overhead, which is calculated by taking its indirect expenses divided by its direct expenses. Indirect expenses are those expenses that are in addition to the the costs needed to produce a part. Direct expenses are exactly that. These include the costs involved or expenses involved in manufacturing the part. Finally, the company adds its mark-up in order to secure a profit on the sale. Profit is critical because it helps to fund the company's pursuit of new product introductions and secure its long-term future. Here is a sample of the Manufacturer Price Sheet in Excel Formathttp://www.driveyoursuccess.com Video explains how to price a product with direct material, labor, overhead and profit",Manufacturing

2345,XoUetvwl834,German Welding Technology - Discover Heavy Weight Manufacture | Technology Connections,"Watch this video if you are interested in Welding technology. The video is about German Welding Technology - Discover Heavy Weight Manufacture | Technology Connections. There are tons of different welding methods, and more are being invented all the time. Some methods use heat  to essentially melt two pieces of metal together, often adding a ""filler metal"" into the joint to act as a binding agent. Other methods rely on pressure to bind metal together, and still others use a combination of both heat and pressure. Unlike soldering and brazing, where the metal pieces being joined remain unaltered, the process of welding always changes the work pieces.This may seem like a trivial point, but it's actually critical to understanding why welding produces such strong bonds. In the processes of soldering and brazing, two pieces of metal are joined by introducing a third material (with a lower melting point) into the mix. Melting this third material between the surfaces of the original pieces binds the pieces together. The bond, however, is only as strong as the joining material. Welding, on the other hand, cuts out the middleman and joins the original pieces directly to each other. The result is a strong, cohesive bond that's often as strong as the material itself. technology information technology in education technology future fabrication vulcan welder",Manufacturing

The short takes on the colossus of Abu-Jamal's contentious case, distilling a mountain of evidence and years of oft-repeated falsehoods to the most fundamental elements of police and prosecutorial misconduct that illustrate a clear and conscious effort to frame Mumia Abu-Jamal for the murder of patrolman Daniel Faulkner. Based on the actual record of investigations and court filings from 1995 to 2003 - evidence denied by the courts and ignored in the press -¬†MANUFACTURING GUILT¬†cuts through the years of absurdities and overt racism to produce a clear picture of how Abu-Jamal's guilt was manufactured and his innocence suppressed beginning only moments after he and Faulkner were found shot in the early morning hours of December 9th, 1981.

We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don‚Äôt produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950¬∞C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",Manufacturing

2405,XE3XJK8CG6I,5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries,"5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical DiscoveriesRich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal‚Äôs skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth‚Äôs body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs next!",History

In this video, I take you to the discovery of gothic architecture and we follow the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral along the centuries.Regarding the fire that damaged the cathedral in april 2019: I already made a donation with my YouTube earnings in the days following the accident. However, at this point, it seems a lot has already been pledged (about ‚Ç¨1bn) and there is no real doubt about the availability of funds to repair the cathedral. The French state owns the building and is responsible for it. These donations represent a lot more than what other causes gather in entire years, some of them involving human lives, education or animal welfare. I think anyone who contributed did a good thing, but at the same time we should not let emotion alone dictate how we exercise our generosity. Other causes may deserve our/your attention, including funds and charities that cater to your local historical heritage. If this fire made you more sensitive to (and aware about) the necessity to take care of it, then maybe helping them will be a better use of funds at this point.

2430,3bL5wWV3mrQ,Musician Careers That Were Destroyed By A Moment In History,"In the music industry, it probably feels pretty good to be at the top of your game. Unfortunately, it also means there‚Äôs only one way to go from there: down. Just ask these musicians, whose careers were destroyed by everything from criminal scandals to wardrobe malfunctions to lip-sync nightmares.  In 1958, rock 'n' roll icon Jerry Lee Lewis decided to take his underage wife with him on his tour of England. What happened next isn‚Äôt much of a surprise. Lewis had neglected to tell anyone he was newly married, so when he rocked up with Myra Gail Lewis in tow, the British press were naturally curious. A Daily Mail reporter, Paul Tanfield, happened to ask how old the newlywed was. Lewis said she was 15 and ended his transatlantic career in one fell swoop.The worst part of all this is that Lewis was lying; Myra was actually 13. Oh, and she was Lewis' cousin, too. Naturally, his British tour collapsed. Those that showed up to his gigs only booed him. Concerts were canceled, his expensive hotel kicked him out, and when he finally hightailed it back to the States, he found he'd been blacklisted from the industry. The radio would no longer play his songs, he was dropped from TV appearances, and demand for his performances all but disappeared, though he never lost his recording contract and continued to release a number of mostly unsuccessful singles.Watch the video for more Musician Careers That Were Destroyed By A Moment In History!#Musicians #CareerKillersJerry Lee Lewis | 0:18Alan Freed | 1:23Ashlee Simpson | 2:38Sinead O'Connor | 3:31Janet Jackson | 4:41Milli Vanilli | 5:51Michael Jackson | 7:04George Michael | 8:35Chuck Berry | 9:28CeeLo Green | 10:24",History

On that day, the nation and government was illegally overthrown by the United States. Since then, the USA has illegally assumed control over Hawaii turning the islands into Military Bases that threaten world peace.The United States claims that Hawaii was lawfully annexed as the 50th State.

In fact the United States government signed a Joint Resolution of the Congress in 1993 that ‚Äúacknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum‚ÄùOn 1999 the Hawaiians reinstated a government pro tempore and continue to implement steps to reinstate laws of the Hawaiian government to reclaim their sovereign independent status from the United States.

This week John looks at some Asian perspectives on Imperialism, specifically writers from countries that were colonized by European powers. We'll look at the writings of Sayyid Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani from the Middle East, Liang Qichao from China, and Rabindranath Tagore from India. these voices from the countries that were colonized give us a sense of how conquered people saw their conquerors, and gives an insight into what these nations learned from being dominated by Europe. It's pretty interesting, OK? A lot of this episode is drawn from a fascinating book by Pankaj Mishra called The Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia.

Sound Designed byRyan Gonzaleshttps://ryangonzalesfilmmaker.weebly.... Game Capture Artist:JagoFollow Him: https://twitter.com/DjagoUnchained DISCLAIMERS ON FORMATS COVERED:Notice I said POPULAR formats, meaning a format where there is a significant amount of people who compete in it for tournaments and so on and so forth. Now Popular does not mean official even though two of the formats I will be covering were official formats being Japan Nintendo Cup and VGC, but it is an indicator of what a good portion of competitive players thought was ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù at the time. Also sometimes the Pokemon Battle Historia doesn't provide enough information to talk about certain Pokemon so I add Smogon analysis to make sense of it. This is pretty rare though.To the people asking why I don't cover Smogon Singles for Gens 1 and 2: It wouldn't really be a history video if I covered those because online Smogon gen 1 meta to my knowledge wasn't actually played until late 2000s. I wanted to cover tournaments/competitive battling that was actually played during the early years of Pokemon (late 90s).To the people asking why I cover Smogon at all for singles: To my knowledge, Smogon was the most popular format for Gens 3-5 and held a number of tournaments throughout the years. As for Gen 6, I am not covering Battle Spot Singles because there is more information and explanations about sets being used relative to their own meta on Smogon. In other words, there are few written analyses about Battle Spot Pokemon besides the Top tiers and I would like to avoid theorycrafting because it may have a hint of bias (though I theorycraft if I REALLY couldn't find information on a certain Pokemon). The keyword here is explanations. Though I did find statistics of most Pokemon used and most moves used, there wasn't really any explanations on why.  Also the few Pokemon I did find analysis of for Top Tier Battle Spot Singles had very similar move sets to the Smogon OU sets anyway. For the record, I do not care what rules or formats people play their battles by nor am I saying these formats are the only formats that should be played. The way you play Pokemon is between you and your opponent and I will not fault you for using evasion or whatever, I just like examining popular tournament formats.Songs Used (List of ALL Songs used for this series.

2483,WjErL1DhRtU,Bastards of the Party [The History of L.A.'s Bloods & Crips - Full Documentary 2005],"The true history of the Bloods and the Crips. In this excellent documentary film, an L.A. gang member explores the true history and origins of the Bloods and the Crips street gangs in the United States.This film shows how in the 1950's, the black communities within the segregated cities in California became hunting grounds for racist white-supremacy gangs. White gangs such as 'The Spook Hunters' would travel into the Afro-American neighborhoods in large numbers to harass, assault, rape, murder and lynch black people on a daily basis. In order to protect the people of the Afro-American communities and neighborhoods against these violent white gangs and against the increasingly racist and violent police departments, different organizations arose, such as the Black Panther Party for self-defense and the US-Organization, among others. With the increasing popularity, expansion of power and structured militancy of the Black Panther Party and the US-Organization, then FBI director J. Edgar Hoover decided to employ the FBI's infamous COINTELPRO operation. The FBI's COINTELPRO operation was intended to create friction and opposition between the various Afro-American organizations and their leaders. Through this policy, the FBI successfully infiltrated, demonized, broke up and neutralized the Black Panthers and the US-Organization. COINTELPRO effectively incarcerated and assassinated any leading figure within these major Afro-American groups. With all the Black Panther and US-Organization leaders either murdered or incarcerated, the CIA then flooded the black communities with tons of cocaine and firearms, in effect sparking the crack epidemic. These circumstances are what eventually laid the foundation for the creation of the opposing Bloods and Crips street gangs we know today. The Bloods and the Crips are the bastard children of the leaders of the Black Panther Party for self-defense. The black communities of major cities in the United States today are presently still divided by these street gangs who are at constant battle for power over turf and control over the drugs trade. The gangs constantly struggle against each other for gang loyalty and out of retaliation of violent acts of the past. This current situation is basically fulfilling the wishes of the racist FBI, CIA and US Government - to never let the black communities unify and rise to power and to never let the Afro-Americans start a real unified insurrection or rebellion against the racist, fascist and oppressive United States Government. If all of the now opposing street gangs could somehow form a truce and unify, they could easily overthrow the local, state and federal government, for they would outnumber and outgun the police and people protecting the US Government power structure, by a 100 to 1 ratio.

2486,ydVFqpbIIwA,First Crusade Part 1 of 2,"The First Crusade was one of the most extraordinary, bloody and significant episodes in medieval history. It began with an appeal for aid from the Christian Byzantine Empire, threatened by the rising power of the Muslim Seljuk Turks. But when Pope Urban II preached a sermon at Clermont in 1095, the result was unlike anything ever seen before. The Pope offered spiritual salvation to those willing to go east to aid their fellow Christians in a holy war,  and help liberate Jerusalem from Muslim rule. Knights and peasants alike signed up in their thousands, leading to the disastrous People's, or Peasants', Crusade, then to a much more organised and powerful Princes' Crusade. Their forces gathered at Constantinople, where they made an uneasy alliance with Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. Entering Anatolia, they helped to win back the city of Nicaea, then won a decisive but hard-fought victory at Dorlyaeum, before marching on the great city of Antioch...Produced in partnership with Osprey Publishinghttps://ospreypublishing.com/Campaign: The First Crusade 1096‚Äì99https://ospreypublishing.com/the-firs...Essential Histories: The Crusadeshttps://ospreypublishing.com/the-crus...The Armies of Islam 7th‚Äì11th Centuries https://ospreypublishing.com/the-armi...Armies of the Crusadeshttps://ospreypublishing.com/armies-o...Music with thanks to Filmstro: https://www.filmstro.com/Get 20% off an annual license!

It's commonly used as a discipline technique, but I've never used it that way - I've only ever used it while grooming, so he does not see it at a punishment and it is completely safe.

It turns out, Iran has a pretty long history of unrest in order to put power in the hands of the people, and the most recent revolution in 1979 was, at least at first, not necessarily about creating an Islamic state. It certainly turned out to be about that, but it was initially just about people who wanted to get rid of an oppressive regime. Listen up as John teaches you about Iran's long history of revolution.Citation 1: Caryl, Christian. Strange Rebels: 1979 and the Birth of the 21st Century.

2508,ebNO_1fnR0g,Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians in History,"Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians and Feminists in HistoryLesbian relationship isn‚Äôt something that surprises people anymore. If couples have to hide even in 2017, what must it have been like a few years ago, when the LGBT community didn't understand their sexuality themselves? The LGBT community owes a lot to the men and women who came before them, knew how society felt about them, and yet, chose to love a member of the same sex openly.10. Josephine BakerJosephine Baker (1906 ‚Äì 1975) American-born French dancer, singer, and actor, was known by many monikers, such as the ‚ÄúBlack Pearl,‚Äù ‚ÄúBronze Venus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreole Goddess.‚Äù She was the first black woman to star in a major film, Zouzou. She married four times, and her adopted son Jean-Claude Baker describes his mother as a bisexual, and recalled his mother as having many ‚Äúlady lovers.‚Äù9. Frida KahloFrida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 ‚Äì 1954), was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. Much has been written about Kahlo, with her works being celerated by feminists for its depiction of the female experience and form. 8. Amrita Sher-GillAmrita Sher-Gil (1913 ‚Äì1941) was an eminent Indian painter, sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo. Her affairs with men and women were quite well known, with her using some of them as models for her work. In fact, her work Two Women is considered to be a painting of herself with her lover Marie Louise.7. Billie Jean KingBillie Jean King (born November 22, 1943) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She was the first prominent female athlete to reveal her sexuality, when details of her affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett, was made public.6. Virginia WoolfAdeline Virginia Woolf (1882 ‚Äì 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Woolf had a passionate relationship with Vita Sackville-West. This relationship inspired one of Woolf's most famous novels, Orlando , featuring the life of a poet who changes sex from man to woman over centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.5. Audre LordeAudre Lorde (1934 ‚Äì 1992) was a black writer, feminist, womanist, and civil rights activist. She described herself as a ‚Äúblack, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,‚Äù and was known for her activist work with Afro-German women in the 1980s.4. Barbara GittingsBarbara Gittings (1932 ‚Äì 2007) was a prominent American activist for gay equality. Gittings served as the President of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, picketed the White House in the 1960s to let the world know how easily homosexuals could be fired simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.3. Jane AddamsJane Addams known as the ""mother"" of Social Work (1860 ‚Äì 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She co-founded Hull House in 1889 with her first romantic partner Ellen Gates Starr. Addams was later in a relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially sound, and supported Addams's work at Hull House. Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.2. Queen Christina of SwedenChristina (1626 ‚Äì 1689) reigned as Queen of Sweden from 1632 to 1654. Queen Christina rejected the role of a woman, which was simply to provide an heir, by announcing that she did not intend to marry. Modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, with many affairs with women noted during her life. Sources have found passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and she was supposed to have had relationships with Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira and the singer Angelina Giorgino.1. SapphoSappho (c. 630 ‚Äì c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. The word ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù is literally derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, where Sappho was born. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Her poems spoke of the infatuations and love, both requited and unrequited, she felt for other women.Music: Greko Sketch by Kevin MacLeod from YouTube Audio LibraryOur Facebook Page http://fb.me/BestTop10Videos",History

Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai.An exquisite example of Indo-Islamic Architecture, associated with legends about doomed lovers, the dargah contains the tomb of Sayed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari.The Haji Ali Dargah was constructed in 1431 in memory of a wealthy Muslim merchant, Sayyed Peer Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, who gave up all his worldly possessions before making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Hailing from Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan, Bukhari travelled around the world in the early to mid 15th century, and eventually settled in present-day Mumbai.According to legends surrounding his life, once the saint saw a poor woman crying on the road, holding an empty vessel. He asked her what the problem was, she sobbed that her husband would thrash her as she stumbled and accidentally spilled the oil she was carrying. He asked her to take him to the spot where she spilt the oil. There, he jabbed a finger into the soil and the oil gushed out. The overjoyed woman filled up the vessel and went home.Later, Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari had a recurring and disturbing dream that he had injured Earth by his act. Full of remorse and grief from that day he became very serious and was not keeping well. Then with the permission of his mother he traveled to India with his brother and finally reached the shore of Mumbai ‚Äì near Worli or at some place opposite the present tomb. His brother went back to their native place. Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari sent a letter with him to their mother informing her that he was keeping good health and that he had decided to reside at that place permanently for the spread of Islam and that she should forgive him.Till his death he kept spreading knowledge about Islam to the people and his devotees would regularly visit him. Before his death he advised his followers that they should not bury him at any proper place or graveyard and should drop his shroud ('kafan') in the ocean such that it should be buried by the people where it is found.His wish was obeyed by his followers. That is why the Dargah Sharief is built at the very site where his shroud came to rest in the middle of the sea where it perched on a small mound of rocks rising above the sea. The Tomb and Dargah Sharief were built in the years to come.On Thursdays and Fridays, the shrine is visited by an enormous number of pilgrims. Irrespective of faith and religion, people visit the dargah to get the blessings of the legendary saint. Sometimes, especially on Fridays, various Sufi musicians perform a form of devotional music called Qawwali at the dargah.Information Referenceshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haji_Al...Video ContainsHaji Ali Dargah Mumbai MysteryHistory of Haji ali and His dargah (mosque)Piya Haji aliCatch me on WHATS-APP +91 7895020430[FOLLOW US]FACEBOOK---  https://goo.gl/RTY7PRWEBSITE---  https://goo.gl/RX8WnvTWITTER---  https://goo.gl/tEowDeINSTAGRAM--- https://goo.gl/dShQpQGOOGLE+---  https://goo.gl/Xo3tRLYOUTUBE---  https://goo.gl/2sGqI9A EPISODE BY AKASH ARORAALL RIGHT RESERVED MyIndia PRODUCTION[CREDITS]VOICE & EDITING = AKASH ARORAACTOR = AKASH ARORAWRITTEN BY = ABHISHEK SAINI & AKASH ARORACopyright disclaimer: Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the copyright Act 1976 allowance is made for, fair use for purposes such as criticism,comment,news,reporting,teaching,scholarship and research.

So, the sixties are often remembered for the liberal changes that the decade brought to America, but lest you forget, Richard Nixon was elected to the presidency during the sixties. The conservative movement didn't start with Nixon though. Modern conservatism really entered mainstream consciousness during the 1964 presidential contest between incumbent president and Kennedy torch-bearer Lyndon B Johnson, and Republican senator Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater never had a shot in the election, he used the campaign to talk about all kinds of conservative ideas. At the same time, several varying groups, including libertarian conservatives and moral conservatives, began to work together. Goldwater's trailblazing and coalition building would pay off in 1968 when Richard Nixon was elected to the White House, and politics changed forever when Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal. You'll also learn about the ERA, , EPA, OSHA, the NTSB, and several other acronyms and initialisms.Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

He brought news from Malta...Suleiman had outlived both his friends and his rivals. Charles V had passed, but his throne had passed to a son who proved just as vexing. An ardent Catholic, Philip II set his ships to harass Ottoman fleets in the Mediterranean and emboldened others to dispute Suleiman's mastery of the sea. The Knights of Malta, whom Suleiman had defeated at Rhodes and allowed to leave peacefully, once again gave safe habor to these Christian ships. Suleiman sent a force to take their island, but his commanders argued with each other and Christian Europe united against him in a way that it could not when he'd been a younger man. The Knights Hospitallier withdrew into their forts. His army struggled for three weeks to take just one of them, and although they succeeded, Suleiman's commander died and the Christian reinforcements had time to join the remaining two forts. At last, faced with yet another fleet of reinforcements, Suleiman's commanders decided to withdraw.Back in his garden, Suleiman knew that this defeat would destroy the invincible image of his empire. He resolved to prove that the Turks were still a force to be feared, and organized a campaign to take Vienna. He would lead them himself. They left in 1566 with great fanfare, but they were immediately greeted by torrential rains that slowed their advance and cost them materiel. Suleiman spent the whole trip confined to a carriage, and when they finally arrived to siege Szeged, he had to retreat a sickbed in his tent. He died while the battle still raged outside, never to know his empire's fate.____________‚ô´ Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4H‚ô´ Get the outro music here!http://bit.ly/23isQfx   *Music by Sean and Dean Kiner: http://bit.ly/1WdBhnm",History

We first learn of the Zulu as a minor tribe of the Bantu people, living in South Africa. Shaka Zulu, the man who would organize them into an empire, was born the illegitimate son of a Zulu king. He was sent away with his mother Nandi to grow up in her tribe, the Langeni, but he eventually caught the attention of Dingiswayo, the leader of another powerful tribe called the Mtethwa. Appointed as the leader of a squadron called an ibutho, Shaka developed new tactics including a short ""iklwa"" fighting spear and a simple but effective military maneuever called ""the Bull Horn."" When his father died, Shaka - now a successful military leader - returned with Dingiswayo's backing to assassinate the rightful heir and assume control of his native tribe. Just a year later, though, the neighboring Ndwandwe tribe murdered Dingiswayo and Shaka vowed revenge on their leader, Zwide. He then launched a bloody war that, combined with the strains created by European colonization, led to the Mefacane, or the Crushing.____________Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4HListen to the outro music here!http://bit.ly/1L6ihlE__________Extra History - England: South Sea BubbleThe Sharp Mind of John Blunt: http://bit.ly/1BFMKocExtra Credits - Why Mechanics Must Be Both Good and AccurateHistorical Games: http://bit.ly/1EKo1Nn",History

2537,5w30XgACSAg,The royal weddings that shaped European history,"To Queen Victoria, marriages were about strategic alliances.Correction: At 5:38, the map of post-war Germany is missing eastern Prussia. The borders of Austria-Hungary should also include portions of northern Serbia and southern Poland.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOThis video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power ‚Äî they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria‚Äôs children were in several important branches of Europe‚Äôs monarchies. The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones.

Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",History

Civil Rights were dominant, but the 60s also saw growth in the Women's Movement, the LGBT rights movement, the Latino rights movement, and the American Indian movement. Also, Americans began to pay a bit more attention to the environment. All this change happened against the backdrop of the Cold War and the Rise of Conservatism. It was just wild.

Why, you may ask, are we covering US History, and not more World History, or the history of some other country, or the very specific history of your home region? Well, the reasons are many. But, like it or not, the United States has probably meddled in your country to some degree in the last 236 years or so, and that means US History is relevant all over the world. In episode 1, John talks about the Native Americans who lived in what is now the US prior to European contact. This is a history class, not archaeology, so we're mainly going to cover written history. That means we start with the first sustained European settlement in North America, and that means the Spanish. The Spanish have a long history with the natives of the Americas, and not all of it was positive. The Spanish were definitely not peaceful colonizers, but what colonizers are peaceful? Colonization pretty much always results in an antagonistic relationship with the locals. John teaches you about early Spanish explorers, settlements, and what happened when they didn't get along with the indigenous people. The story of their rocky relations has been called the Black Legend. Which is not a positive legend.Turn on the captions.

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π', which means 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he called Ivan 'the Terrible' in this video? Because he was evil or useless? No, it is because '–ì—Ä–æÃÅ–∑–Ω—ã–π' was first translated into English many years ago as 'Terrible', when the word commonly meant awesome or formidable (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...).

Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv10. Columbus Discovered America9. Paul Revere8. 13 Colonies7. Washington Cherry Tree6. The Crossing of the Delaware5. Van Gogh Cut off EarWhile in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don‚Äôt mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn‚Äôt want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 4. Sphinx NoseHow did the Sphinx lose it‚Äôs nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt‚Äôs antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it‚Äôs still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400‚Äôs say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa‚Äôim al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 3. Vikings Horned HelmetsArchaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800‚Äôs when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies2. StonehengeOne of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they‚Äôve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don‚Äôt tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it‚Äôs highly doubtful that they‚Äôve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,‚ÄùNearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.‚Äù This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it‚Äôs being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 1. First ThanksgivingSorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there‚Äôs absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn‚Äôt be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won‚Äôt get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don‚Äôt let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",History

But that version of the network is long gone today. Here are the biggest scandals to hit the reality TV outlet that's now simply called History.Ice Road Truckers is one of History's best-known reality shows, depicting the perilous lives of drivers in the iciest regions of Canada and Alaska. And sure, it's been criticized by actual trucker media like Truck News for exaggerating or even faking some of the danger.But real scandal hit the show in 2013. According to a CBS report, star Tim Zickuhr abducted Lisa Cadeau after hiring her for escort work in Las Vegas. He claimed she overcharged him by $1,000 and demanded she meet him to settle the dispute. It was then that he dragged her back to his apartment, beat her, and tied her up in a closet.Fearing for her life, Cadeau gave Zickuhr the phone number of an undercover police officer, claiming he could pay her ransom. Zickuhr called the number and unknowingly arranged his own arrest. The Las Vegas Sun reported Zickuhr confessed on the spot that he intended to hold Cadeau hostage and prostitute her through Craigslist.Watch the video for more about The Biggest Scandals To Ever Hit The History Channel.#History #HistoryChannel #ScandalIce Road Truckers | 0:15The Kennedys | 1:21Swamp People | 2:19Bigfoot Captured | 3:07Hunting Hitler | 3:57Amelia Earhart | 4:44American Pickers | 5:47The Bible | 6:25Alone | 7:17Mountain Men | 8:15Ax Men | 9:22Pawn Stars | 10:30",History

The prophet Abraham is central to the three great monotheistic faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Yet, despite these shared origins, and the reconciliatory promise to Abraham that ""all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed by you"", his descendants have often resembled a squabbling, dysfunctional family. Dowd's journey of discovery is an attempt to grapple with the big questions: Why, if there is one God, are there three so-called monotheistic faiths? Why do some people abuse religion to demonise their enemies while others build bridges to them? And why have the ""children of Abraham"" often fallen so short of the legacy of unity that was promised to the prophet?Content licensed from Digital Rights Group (DRG).

""What was not clear was the source of that meat. However, we have compared the type of prey killed by lions and leopards today with the type of prey selected by humans in those days. This has shown that men and women could not have been taking kill from other animals or eating those that had died of natural causes. They were selecting and killing what they wanted.""Once our species got a taste for meat, it was provided with a dense, protein-rich source of energy. We no longer needed to invest internal resources on huge digestive tracts that were previously required to process vegetation and fruit, which are more difficult to digest. This new, energy-rich resource was then diverted inside our bodies and used to fuel our growing brains. over the next two million years our crania grew, producing species of humans with increasingly large brains",History

A main part of my ministry is to educate so that lies can be truly seen and bondage be broken.  Many people are against Christianity for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is they don't understand the history behind it.  So my next series of videos will be educating my viewers on the history of religion.

They came into contact with the Romans, who ruled the entire peninsula for over four centuries until the late 300s CE. They were replaced with various Germanic kingdoms, who were in turn replaced by the Islamic Caliphate. What followed was a gradual reconquest of the area, which had been completed by 1492. After a strengthening of the union of Castile and Aragon in 1516, Iberia took a form roughly similar to today.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Support me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4740833Follow me on DeviantArt: http://olliebye.deviantart.com/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Map: http://new.demis.nl/products/web-map-...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks to:Drex for researching TeeMee for helping speed up the animation process with ""Number Animationer""----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music:Llibre Vermell - Stella Splendens",History

2594,CcUk4xy-Ai8,History of Jailbreaking,"basically, jailbreaking is a type of ‚Äúprivilege escalation.‚Äù Now that‚Äôs a pretty technical term so let me break it down. User privilege refers to how much access a user has to any given system, in this case iOS. And when you jailbreak your iPhone, you gain additional access to parts of the operating system that were previously restricted ‚Äì so you‚Äôre achieving an escalated level of privilege on your device, so privilege escalation. And this is usually achieved by exploiting some kind of design flaw or bug in the operating system. So to sum it up, jailbreaking is a way for users to do a lot more with their iPhone than what was previously possible.The term ‚Äújailbreaking‚Äù originated with iOS, which began pretty much as soon as iPhones were released, but it‚Äôs been used to describe privilege escalation in other systems as well, like Playstation. Similar tools have been developed for other systems in recent years. For example, ‚Äúrooting‚Äù became a popular process among Android phone and tablet users to escalate privileges on those devices. Thanks to a huge community of hackers, developers, and coders that love to tinker with technology, there‚Äôs been a way to jailbreak pretty much every iteration of iOS within a short time of their release.",History

The sacred herb was always seen by Shamans and the ancients as a gift from the Creator God(s) of life on Earth. Like food nourishes the body, Cannabis provides nourishment for the mind and works it‚Äôs magic with the soul. Also explored in this documentary is the American relationship with hemp, including it‚Äôs ban during the 1920?s and the various uses of the hemp plant. Cannabis Sativa is an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is a herb that has been used throughout recorded history by humans as a source of fiber, for its seed oil, as food, as medicine and for spiritual purposes. Different parts of the plant have different uses, and different varieties are cultivated in different ways and harvested at different times, depending on the purpose for which it is grown. Cannabis or Ganja is associated with Shiva, who is popularly believed to like the hemp plant.",History

During and after the American Revolutionary War, the government of the new country operated under the Articles of Confederation. While these Articles got the young nation through its war with England, they weren't of much use when it came to running a country. So, the founding fathers decided try their hand at nation-building, and they created the Constitution of the United States, which you may remember as the one that says We The People at the top. John will tell you how the convention came together, some of the compromises that had to be made to pass this thing, and why it's very lucky that the framers installed a somewhat reasonable process for making changes to the thing.

I'd lean more toward horrifying and depressing institution, but nobody asked me. John will talk about what life was like for a slave in the 19th century United States, and how slaves resisted oppression, to the degree that was possible. We'll hear about cotton plantations, violent punishment of slaves, day to day slave life, and slave rebellions. Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, and Whipped Peter all make an appearance.

Unfortunately it's the only copy I've been able to obtain so far.__________________________Narrated by David AckroydCharles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.____________",History

Nuclear war is not only imaginable, but planned. The greatest build-up of NATO military forces since the Second World War is under way on the western borders of Russia. On the other side of the world, the rise of China is viewed in Washington as a threat to American dominance. To counter this, President Obama announced a ‚Äòpivot to Asia‚Äô, which meant that almost two-thirds of all US naval forces would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific, their weapons aimed at China. A policy which has been taken up by his successor Donald Trump, who during his election campaign said ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt continue to allow China to rape our country and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù.Filmed on five possible front-lines across Asia and the Pacific over two years, the story is told in chapters that connect a secret and ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô past to the rapacious actions of great power today and to a resistance, of which little is known in the West.Distributed by Sideways FilmsTo be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

Our traditional perception of the Crusades as European Colonization thinly veiled in religion isn't quite right. John covers the First through the Fourth Crusades, telling you which were successful, which were well-intentioned yet ultimately destructive, and which were just plain crazy. Before you ask, no, he doesn't cover the Children's Crusade, in which children were provoked to gather for a Crusade, and then promptly sold into slavery by the organizers of said Crusade.

2641,okcfKaC87r4,"American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074...It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:The American Adventure (1975)American Adventures (1987)American History (1982)The American Pageant (1991)The American Tradition (1984)The American Way (1979)The Challenge of Freedom (1990)Discovering American History (1974)Land of Promise (1983)Life and Liberty (1984)Triumph of the American Nation (1986)The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:The American Journey (2000)The American Pageant (2006)The Americans (2007)America: Pathways to the Present (2005)A History of the United States (2005)Holt American Nation (2003)Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the novel Deadline by Chris Crutcher.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the liner notes of the Rise Against album, The Sufferer & the Witness.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_...",History

Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:The American Adventure (1975)American Adventures (1987)American History (1982)The American Pageant (1991)The American Tradition (1984)The American Way (1979)The Challenge of Freedom (1990)Discovering American History (1974)Land of Promise (1983)Life and Liberty (1984)Triumph of the American Nation (1986)The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:The American Journey (2000)The American Pageant (2006)The Americans (2007)America: Pathways to the Present (2005)A History of the United States (2005)Holt American Nation (2003)Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the novel Deadline by Chris Crutcher.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the liner notes of the Rise Against album, The Sufferer & the Witness.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_...",History

2703,Jzl9Q3g35ow,PHILIPPINES: The Hidden History of Ancient Kingdoms and Empires,"-This video is not an Anti-Hispanic culture documentary and doesn't aim to abolished Hispanic/American culture in Philippines, I think it's important to remember that we need to appreciate every collective culture that history has throwned to the islands of the Philippines, for it would be a monument of the richness of the country, to remind every Filipinos that many great nations with different cultures of the world have fought for it's richness but in the end it was taken back by the Filipino people, and the Filipino people alone. That way they can feel a sense of uniqueness among the other Asian cultures! i don't want this video to be misunderstoodplus it could make Spain and America get away with everything they did while colonizing The Philippines, if Filipinos just erase the culture as if that part of history never happened. I personally saw it happening today. Some Spanish or even Mexican and Americans people today are rejecting the fact that they did colonized Philippines at all. Why? because Filipinos are destroying every evidence of it from their cultures and architectures[for more info watch: https://goo.gl/eN6Xnk ] thinking they belong to Asia when that is not the case! Colonial era is already part of Philippine history! and no matter what, history will never change! European cultures is already passed to Philippines and you cannot forced it not to.Colonial history is the only part of history that has a direct contact with the pre-colonial era as it is the sequel of the story,...  if the rejection of colonial evidence(demolishing many heritage cities instead of rebuilding a replicating it) still continues, even history of colonization might even be rejected as a myth and this is very possible.This Video only aims to let them appreicate the lost Pre-Hispanic cultures too.The Lost History of Ancient Philippine Kingdoms and Empires, Unknown to present day mainstream Philippine Education.

So how did this war happen? And what does it mean? We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves.

2705,ZTC_RxWN_xo,Secret History of Silicon Valley,"[Recorded: November 20, 2008]Today, Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants, today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency.In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane, venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.Catalog Number: 102695046Lot Number: X5082.2009",History

2758,1-JAx3nUwms,A Brief History of Pi,"Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclarkCheck out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History A few nitpicky things:- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained, so I thought I'd put this here.- Lastly, I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history, which I highly recommend.You can support the channel by donating at http://www.patreon.com/simonoxfphys---------- II ----------Huge thanks to my supporters on Patreon: Dan Hanvey, David Efird,  Elliot Conway, Robert Eldon, Syafiq Kay, Xavier Chesterfield, Jay Wright, Myles Kornfeld, Louis Gillet, Michael Phillips, Neudys Almonte, Fraser Birks, Martin Hermes, Anh Duong, Luca Schumann, Rhys Rickard-Frost, Cameron Matchett, Lachlan Woods, Tim Boxall, Simon Vaes, Gabriele Mozzicato, Jawad Alalasi, Gaia Frazao Nery, Kodzo, Josh Ruby, Claire Anthony, Eve Dillon, Rowan Gow, Matthias Loos, James Bridges, James Craig, Angela, Sanaa Al Derei, Mark Anthony Magro, Liam, Theresa Wang, Kieran Kelly, Wendover Productions, Kendra Johnson, Caitlin Louise.---------- II ----------Vlogs from Oxford students - http://www.youtube.com/oxvlogMy twitter - http://www.twitter.com/simonoxfphysMy facebook - http://www.facebook.com/youtubesimonMy insta - http://www.instagram.com/simonoxfphysMy goodreads - http://www.goodreads.com/simonoxfphysThanks to Vlogbrothers for their sponsorship of this video.

Farmers would build irrigation systems supporting villages and towns. Later some warrior would bring these towns under his rule and form a united political entity, like a kingdom or an empire. Then a tribe of nomads would come along and conquer the kingdom, seize all the holdings and settle in their place and further expand the new empire. As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellers. Exactly the kind of people they had conquered and at this point another tribe of nomads would come along and conquer them and take their empire. Conquest, consolidation, expansion, degeneration and conquest, this was the pattern of history.Be sure to follow CaspianReport on the social media.Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/caspianreportTwitter:https://twitter.com/caspianreportLiveLeak:http://www.liveleak.com/c/caspianreport",History

A History of School Librarianship","Wayne Wiegand discusses his current research project -- a history of the American public-school library. This project incorporated five perspectives: the history of public-school education, the history of American librarianship, the social history of reading (including the history of print culture), the history of childhood, and the history of cultural institutions as places. The biblical passage in the title -- quoted by a famous school library leader in a 1979 article -- expresses school librarianship's decades-old frustration at being positioned between the education and library professions and having its obvious contributions frequently overlooked and undervalued by both. Speaker Biography: Wayne Wiegand is the F. William Summers Professor Emeritus of Library and Information Studies and American Studies at Florida State University. During his tenure at the John W.

By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.Crash Course World History is now available on DVD!

2876,k7ngnWJ6Hks,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children‚Äôs collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen‚Äôs works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

2897,daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.

The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter.

Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZsArt and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA √âtat d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-ameri...From With One Voice's website: With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people ‚Äì celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates https://www.atsa.qc.ca/en/eu-2017-wit...

2900,jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.Regarding Rajae El MouhandizRajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world.

The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; etc. etc.  up to one hour. This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones. Subscribe to The Brainwave Hub for the best brainwave entrainment audios, as well as our partner channel, The Meditation Music Hub: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...--The Brainwave Hub offers high quality binaural beats and isochronic tones.

2916,Soq4M_hu-Nc,Aboriginal Art and Music,"A quick look at some aboriginal art .. All images taken from google images . The audio is from something called Songs From The Northern Territory 4Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt Artist/Collector: Alice Moyle Label Information: Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD Media Type: CD Year: Recorded 1963; Released 1997 Availability: AIATSIS Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt. The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay (north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer time to decide which words to sing next); c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources at the same time. Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.Manikay.comIt is such a shame that so much aboriginal culture has been lost .. Its good to see that some remains .",Art and Music

Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains, ‚ÄúThe festival's title, ‚ÄúDay For Night,‚Äù provides the main key to understand the work being presented, as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will, in one way or another, transform our feeling of time, space, perspective, and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light, time, and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal, or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists, we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.‚ÄùWith acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians, each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence, Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.",Art and Music

They are motivated to share the values, knowledge, wisdom, stories, songs, tales, fables, epics, jokes, traditional games, riddles etc. overall everything falling within the domain of folklore of their respective regions.

2925,9RQ-Ha9JmpI,"The Harlem Renaissance:  The Rise of African American Literature, Art, and Music","This short film, produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael, CA,  is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music, Art, and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time, it was known as the ""New Negro Movement"", named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature, drama, music, visual art, dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology, historiography, philosophy), artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism, African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms, they explored their identities as black Americans, celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery, as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies, who had migrated to New York in number, were part of the movement. Moreover, many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this ""flowering of Negro literature"", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison, ""The Father of Harlem Radicalism,"" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper of the ""New Negro Movement"". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had ""Poetry for the People"" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the ""Negro Literary Renaissance"" notion overlooked ""the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"", and said the so-called ""renaissance"" was largely a white invention.

This exhibition features an exciting selection of early work as well as very recent work by Ronnie and includes a number of portraits of The Rolling Stones. Created from an insider's perspective, Ronnie portrays his colleagues, his friends, and band-mates, both in group portraits and individually, with an insight and intimacy not accessible to anyone else. Through line and colour, he deftly captures the creative energy of his musical world, showing us a view different from what we might see in the concert hall or arena.

The concert program included 26 everything numbers. It's includes a playing on musical instruments (solo performance) and dance numbers.

Kovaleva municipal formation ""City of Saratov"" T.V. Chubarov. I had to closely monitor the performance of the participants of the competition. To say that the guys and girls were not worried would be wrong. Of course, they long time and stubbornly went to it's concert to showing their skill and talent performed at this stage.And to look, really was what here in. The vocal and choral group by name ""Arioso"" by  woman conductor  E.S.Senckevich, always amazes with it's many tember voices and vocal singing skills, the ability to perform virtuosly work in one breath there. But this time, the guys have surpassed themselves, I'm think. Valentina Alontseva, Yaroslav Kisilyov, with her playing the accordion, showed how close this instrument is to them too. Egor Zimenkov, Ivan Stepantsov, Ali Isengaliev, Alexei Baranov with the support of teacher of children's schools by accordion class N.A. Shvydkovoy forced the viewer no breath. Polina Galitskaya, Maria Gulak, Maria Oleinikova, Sarsen Incarbekova (upright piano) and others were able to subordinate grand piano, make it laugh and sob theirs playing. The performance of Nikita Kutakhin and Andrei Kulzhanov, known as the duo ""NikAnder"", took place nice again.The ""dance"", a children's dance group known in the region, "" has flashing"" on the dance floor, adding to the grace and plasticity the brightness of theirs costumes and owns enthusiasm that was passed to all those who came to see and support the contestants on this important day.The jury had the opportunity to evaluate the performance of the guys from ""CANAREYKA"" original name (canary-finch) puppet theater. Although the artists themselves are not visible during the performance, they tried to convey the emotions and feelings to theirs dolls, playing as sincerely as possible so that the viewer believed in the reality of what was happening here.Christina Skrypnyk performed in the nomination ""solo performance, vocal"". Her performance fascinated the members of the jury, and it was she who passed the final selection. Art school teachers hope that our young ‚Äústar‚Äù will take part in the gala concert, which will be held in the regional center (Saratov city). And we wish her good luck and we shall believe and hope in her victory in!Aida Bogdalova",Art and Music

2983,OxI6uPQwu8I,Composer Chat 03 - Art and Music - Limitation as Freedom,"I am discussing the concept of limitation in the context of artistic freedom. When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.Join me for more talks about art, inspiration, and all things creative.This episode features the music from my album Lacrimosa: http://www.dosiamckay.com/lacrimosa.s...My website: http://dosiamckay.com/My compositions: http://www.dosiamckay.com/recordings....My paintings: http://www.dosiamckay.com/art/gallery...My writing and poetry: https://musicwell.wordpress.com/Follow meFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dosiamckay/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dosiamckayGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+DosiaMcKayYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/dosiamckay",Art and Music

2986,bo1iPm_eiQI,Engineering and Music: A Powerful Duet for Art and Science - Science Nation,"University of Rochester electrical engineer Mark Bocko has combined his passion for music with his passion for engineering, devising a way to digitally reproduce music in files 1,000 times smaller than an mp3! But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like ‚Äúchord‚Äù and ‚Äúvoice leading‚Äù correspond to geometrical concepts like ‚Äúvectors in an orbifold.‚Äù This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life. His award-winning artwork has been exhibited and performed in galleries and venues throughout the United States and around the world. Selikoff is represented by Snap!

3012,lgGf6WuUQro,"""Art and Music"" by Art and Music","https://www.klbinternationalpublishin...""Art and Music"" by Art and MusicLets be honest, Kasey Jones of Art and Music is currently not an award winning artist, songwriter or producer. If he had Record Company, Drug Cartel, Big Pharma, Government Military money he probably could be. Why? Because kids, you can buy your way to the top in this game we are all playing. Don't think you are a part of it? Think again and hit the books. So till the scales tip and above becomes below he will be frequently relocated to earth to fulfill his soul contract after numerous other glorious failed attempts.  He is passionate about making intimate and poignant songs using outdated and unreliable equipment in his living room. He's scrappy, hungry, skilled at burning bridges and primed to explode at any moment. Possibly implode. Art and Music's highly unanticipated second album ‚ÄúWho are They‚Äù, is a completely independent release. Jones produced, recorded, engineered and performed every instrument on this release, highlighting his versatility and broad musical scope. Further demonstrating his sheer insanity.One of the most exciting things about Art and Music is that Jones can exercise full creative control over every stage of the music-making experience, from conception to fruition!He blissfully watches mindless robot sheep perpetuate in consumer stupor, narrowly avoiding mental breakdowns most of the time. Money is a hoax, debt is slavery, media is manipulation, religion is controlled, the system is a lie and Art and Music is awesome!https://www.klbinternationalpublishin...",Art and Music

3023,WJaR7rJqKIk,"Art and Incarceration:  Poetry, Theatre and Music in and about Captivity","For this interdisciplinary performance, Ensemble Pi presented music, text, and theater works that focus on the rise of mass incarceration, the racial disparities it reveals, and the emotional toll it takes on inmates and their families. The evening started with the world premiere of Rikers Island by New York composer Eleanor Cory, inspired by the anthology These Are Hard Times for Dreamers. Followed by Rzewski‚Äôs minimalist masterpiece, Coming Together, composed in the wake of the 1971 prison riots in upstate New York and powerfully expressing the frustration of life behind bars and anger about injustice. Joseph Assadourian, the narrator for Coming Together, will also perform an excerpt from his tragi-comic play, The Bullpen, based on his own incarceration. The performance closed with the sublime Olivier Messiaen‚Äôs Quartet for the End of Time (1941), composed and performed in the prisoner-of-war camp in Gorlitz, Germany, capturing the hardship and sadness of being in prison, while still conveying optimism.About the presenters:Ensemble Pi is a new music collective that uniquely connects pressing social and political issues and the idioms of classical contemporary music. They began a Peace Concerts series 10 years ago in response to the invasion of Iraq, and have since presented annual chamber music concerts giving voice to the struggle for peace. Every concert includes at least one commission, as well as contemporary classical masterpieces to address the historical tradition of ‚Äúsocially conscious‚Äù compositions. In the past, the group has collaborated with visual artists, writers, journalists and actors ‚Äì including South African artist William Kentridge and American journalists Naomi Wolf and Jeremy Scahill ‚Äì and have featured the music of John Harbison, Frederic Rzewski, Shostakovich and Penderecki. The Peace Concerts series has also protested the censorship of media, fracking, the Apartheid, and more. Performers include: Alexis Gerlach, cello; Moran Katz, clarinet; Idith Meshulam Korman, piano; Airi Yoshioka, violin; and Joseph Assadourian, actor and narrator. The group is joined by local Houston musicians Craig Hauschildt, percussion and Daniel Egan, trumpet.c Rothko Chapel/Runaway Productions",Art and Music

3039,XCRbISUfU2Y,Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art,"When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.Follow the Banff Centre:Website: https://banffcentre.caFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheBanffCentreTwitter: https://twitter.com/thebanffcentreiTunes: http://apple.co/1A2DMmxSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/banff-centre-r...",Art and Music

3053,HysDgonGMCI,Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal,"Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‚ÄòArt and music are antidotes to intolerance‚Äô says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT‚Äôs January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, ‚ÄúAao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste‚Ä¶‚ÄùThis is a joint production of Communalism Combat, Newsclick and Hillele.org",Art and Music

3057,N0u04EqNVjo,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtvCreated By:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEhttps://twitter.com/bryanraymond www.KillYourIdols.comBO BUSHNELLhttps://twitter.com/BoBushnellInstagram.com/BoBushnellhttp://bobushnell.comDIRECTED BY:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:EMMA REEVESJOHN TOBAEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLSTARRING:RAYMOND PETTIBONKEITH MORRISCHUCK DUKOWSKIHENRY ROLLINSFLEACAMERA:JOSH WEBBERBO BUSHNELLJASON BAKEREDITED BY:TIM BROOKSBEAST EDITORIALASSISTANT EDITOR:PAUL JAROLIMEKPRONERBEAST EDITORIALLOCATION SOUND:NOAH ALEXANDERCHARLES EASTMONDMOTION GRAPHIC DESIGN:BRENT STANGELMUSIC SUPERVISION:BETA PETROLMUSIC BY:RAW NERVETHEME MUSIC:SON THE FATHER by FUCKED UPCOURTESY BEGGARS GROUPADDITIONAL MUSIC BY:C.R.A.S.H.SCANNING BY:JESSE SPEARSSOUND MIXING:PHIL LANTZM SQUARED PRODUCTIONSCOLORIST:TIM BROOKSPHOTO STILLS PROVIDED BY:BRIAN TUCKERED COLVERSPOTRYAN RICHARDSONLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusArtIsForYou20",Art and Music

These surrealistic happenings have inspired most of the great show business artists.So, for the first time in France the connection , the similitude and the influence that Dali had upon Jackson will be shown.Both geniuses have suffered from the same kind of curse , the feeling of being the substitute of their born dead older brother . Effectively , after the death of a previous child , Dali‚Äôs and Jackson‚Äôs parents have decided to make another one immediately , a heavy burden to carry for the young Salvador and Michael.Dali, all along his life, talked about this trauma , which led him to this constant need of being different, of being the main attraction.Michael Jackson , though performing in a different field of art , walked the same kind of path, and also had this need to be different, even from his own brothers , this need to lead his own life and career away from ‚Äúthe Jackson five‚Äù.FIND MORE INFORMATION ON THIS EXHIBITION AT musee@ville-bormes.frjordipictural@gmail.comAerial view by : GregPhilobates productionfilmed by ART IN FUSION TV ELVIJS PLUGIS",Art and Music

3066,Xcmijqbd8kc,"'Hey Bill Nye, What's the Evolutionary Purpose of Music and Art?'","The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives, explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.Read more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/bill-nye-o...Follow Big Think here:YouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcomTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthinkTranscript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",Art and Music

By investigating the fundamental geometric forms of both Islamic art and Gothic architecture, there is a connection between religious influence, visual creativity and architectural  structure that strengthens physical capacity to the human experience. Relating these two art forms to music theory provides an introduction to the progress of music sciences in the modern age; including Cymatics, a 20th century science of wave phenomenon that demonstrates various geometric shapes of frequencies and musical pitch. This interdisciplinary approach of visualizing the common geometric forms of art, architecture, and music questions the anticipatory influence and outlook of the arts for future generations.",Art and Music

This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

3102,0aO7m6O3g-g,"The Escape Festival of Art and Music 2013 - Naukuchiatal, Uttarakhand, India | CULTURE","BY AJAY JAINIf you want to get a feel of art and culture, head to the Indian Himalayas for the annual Escape Festival that place in the summers. It takes place along the lakes of Naukuchiatal in the state of Uttarakhand, about an eight hour drive from New Delhi. Here is more about the festival as taken from the official website, http://escapefestival.in: ""A unique festival started in May 2009 when a few musicians and like-minded people decided to get away from New Delhi for a few days. They chose a picturesque resort at Naukuchiatal, at the foothills of the Himalayas which became their Escape.Escape, has grown since then to become one of India's foremost outdoor art, music & camping festival.The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family. It is also one of the first festivals in the country set around a scenic getaway appealing to young and old alike. Three days. Two stages. One pristine lake. The lilt of music in the hills, the sublime experience of art, the unfettered sense of joy as you give into the magic of the moment.Enough reasons to escape amidst the serene surroundings of Naukuchiatal. The three-day Escape Festival of Arts and Music, in its 6th Chapter in 2013, has slowly but surely become the cause of a mass exodus of all music fans from the summer heat. The Escape Festival of Art & Music addresses the needs of a wide group of artists and audience by bringing them together under one roof. It sets the benchmark in showcasing talent and creating a unique atmosphere of creative exchange and camaraderie amongst its attendees. The 'real time' experience coalesces into a unique experience which can only have the fitting title term of 'Escape'. An initiative by Potheads, the Escape Festival of Art & Music, is a creative retreat and will feature bands, artists, writers, photographers, painters, graffiti artists, performance artists, tattoo artists and potters, in a m√©lange of talent. In addition to that, the festival will also feature a festival camp, adventure sports and a flea market at the breathtaking venue right on the shores of Lake Naukuchiatal, Uttrakhand. The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family.In its 6th Chapter, The Escape Festival of Art and Music 2013 will see the performances spread over three days and two stages - The Soul Garden Stage and the Magic Forest Stage.The Soul Garden is aimed at a listening audience with the lake as a backdrop for the stage. This stage will feature some of the most musically talented artists from the genres of Jazz, Blues, Folk, Sufi and Rock Music from the four corners of IndiaThe Magic Forest is an EDM (Electronic Dance Music) Stage supported by an elaborate array of lights and visuals. The Magic Forest Stage will feature National and International Artists from the EDM sub-genres of Chill, Dub-step, Drum'n'Bass and Psytrance Music.The festival also features a mini film festival, which is the screening of independently produced documentaries by National and International film makers.In the areas of Photography, Painting, Pottery, Graffiti and other art forms outdoor exhibitions, live painting, workshops and participation programs will be the order of the day wherein one will experience art in a natural setting.""If you missed it the last time around, don't miss it next year.*********************************************************************************A Kunzum TV Production by Ajay JainCreatives by madpauleMusic: Track ""The Crosses of Annagh.

3117,2MhjkAbF00U,Art x Music: Sound artist Haroon Mirza and Dave Maclean (Django Django),"Sound artist Haroon Mirza discusses the relationship between fine art and electronic music with Dave Maclean, the drummer and producer of indie band Django Django who has recently remixed Mirza's sound works under the moniker of Jellyman to create a dancefloor track that has been released by The Vinyl Factory.Alongside Factory Floor who also reworked Mirza's experiments for release by The Vinyl Factory, Jellyman's remix explores the liminal space between art and music, which both Maclean and Mirza believe is more a matter of context than classification. Riffing on similar themes during this revealing conversation, Dave and Haroon discuss the role of musicians in gallery spaces, the aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Detroit techno and the ways in which Haroon's turntable experiments reflect a broader trend in DIY DJ culture to doctor and modify records to create live loops and samples.To read more about the remix collaborations and hear both tracks, click here.To order a copy of Jellyman's remix, visit our shop.",Art and Music

3137,SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),"Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z3Rmw... I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about 1:23:34 in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends‚Äîand perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",Art and Music

Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art NouveauPrague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague‚Äôs history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague‚Äôs musical tradition ‚Äì from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak ‚Äì will be introduced.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/pra...DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers.

This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

In addition to the art galleries there are artists showing their work on Pirate's Alley and the section of Royal Street behind St. Louis Cathedral. In this video you first see the excellent trad jazz band that plays most days on the corner of Royal and St. Peters. Then we move up to the artists near the cathedral. There is some of my work, Bill Ives, and that of Jim Bilgere.  Next, we see a Mardi Gras parade by the children in a local school that features several brass bands, including Rebirth. There are also Mardi Gras Indians. Next, are the Irish celebrating St. Patrick's Day early, stopping at several bars including Pat O'Brien's. Then a brief look at the piano bar inside Pat O'Brien's. Finally, we see three second lines connected to weddings. These are just some typical street scenes on Royal Street. Come on down and join us.",Art and Music

Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art NouveauPrague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague‚Äôs history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague‚Äôs musical tradition ‚Äì from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak ‚Äì will be introduced.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/pra...DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers.

3201,QgPEaC1WECM,Abstract Art from Music,"Disclaimer: I am not an abstract painter. I was put in Abstract Painting as a random choice of the school my first semester. I prefer draw from observation:meaning realistic drawing. Project was to listen to some music and interpret colors and abstract forms from the music. I chose my friend Eli's song 'Ukulele Fun' that he put together one day when he decided to pick up the uke and cello (crazy talented musician)But as I see stories through music, this proved difficult; I don't see blobs, I see people and scenes.

Cancer can also significantly impact a child's psychosocial state - their emotions, behaviors, thoughts. A child's psychosocial state also impacts his or her relationships with family, friends, peers, etc. Art therapy and music therapy are just two of the many programs our staff offers to patients with cancer. These programs help patients express their emotions in a healthy, effective way. They also serve as a distraction when things get especially difficult during treatment or in the hospital.Our therapists are nationally certified and offer the best possible care to our patients and often times engage the entire family in sessions.Learn more about our music therapy program (here: http://bit.ly/11DHCvn) and our other psychosocial services for patients and their families (here:http://bit.ly/11DHyMc)Learn more about Tammi Young-Saleme (here:http://bit.ly/11DHzji)Watch a music therapy session at Nationwide Children's here: http://bit.ly/11DHCf3",Art and Music

For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:DrawingPaintingSculptureWriting Video CreationAnimationDesignFilmMusicetc.",Art and Music

It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.Tweet -  @dannywolverton https://twitter.com/dannywolvertonI invite you to follow me on facebook and twitter: http://www.facebook.com/realspecialheadhttps://twitter.com/dannywolverton http://www.specialhead.comhttp://www.facebook.com/wolvertondanny Special Head LevitationHe is  best known for his appearances on America‚Äôs Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!""The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me, That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

As a whole, his works are images which find echo in other visible or invisible zones of Creation, portals towards parallel worlds.Being interested in the infinity of Time and in the Physical and Metaphysical space the artist, through harmonious joining of the flat forms with the 3D ones, decomposes temporary spaces in order to reconstruct them contortedly in non-temporal dimensions managing with magical skill to build unimaginable spaces and plans, revealing and offering to the spectator new visions on the infinite and perennial Creation.The themes come from the philosophical system of the artist, who, not agreeing with the idea of metempsychosis, considers that the transmigration of soul cannot only take place from one level to the other (the physical level -- the astral one and only on the Terrestrial level) but from one planetary system to the other, being possible that after death of the physical body the soul to rebirth in another physical body from another planet from the physical Universe, thus suggesting the concept of interplanetary transmigration.In a world in which culture, in general, as well as art, in particular, become more and more infantile with the passing of time, Edi APOSTU offers to the seekers of original and highly qualitative fine art a new vision in the field, proposing to the public the holotropic painting, a type of painting in which the complementary -- contrasting chromatics is chosen in such a way so to catch the eye of the spectator and to transpose it into states above the conscience.Edi APOSTU challenges the spectator to explore new dimensions, beyond time and space, his painting being an opening to new virtual and sensatory horizons.‚ÄûThe holotropic art is the art which is the result of  transpersonal experiences and which can transpose the beholder into states of overconsciousness.All my artistic creation, eiher painting, graphycs or poetry, is rich in symbols and universal archetypes. Even if most of my works are abstract, they transmit subtle messages and have as source of inspiration The Source, the Universal Source from which Information comes, information which materializes in the physical plan in my creations.I consider my artistic achievements as a stage in the process of both artistic self-perfection but especially in the spiritual one, because creating them I raised existential and metaphysical problems to myself and I think that the inspiration the artist receives while giving birth to a work of art can become an answer, because the artistic creation cannot have, in my opinion, a strictly human origin.Personally, I consider that the art is the most fascinating manifestation of the Divine creator at the terrestrial and physical level, through which there is made the connection between the limited-ephemeral human condition and the infinite-eternal Divine.""The name Holotropic means literally ""moving toward wholeness"" (from the Greek ""holos"" = whole and ""trepein"" = moving in the direction of something)",Art and Music

We started with the Great Wall of China (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCaH-...). As our tour of Brazil approached we set our sights on our next Wonder: Christ the Redeemer. This incredible piece of art soars 10 stories in the air, stretches 100 feet wide and weighs 1.4 million pounds (630,000 kg). But even more impressive is that it was built in the 1920's on a peak of a sheer 2,300 ft. (700 meters) cliff overlooking Rio de Janeiro. Not far from this inspiring statue are the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil -- a natural Wonder of the World. Made up of 275 waterfalls that stretch across 1.7 miles (2.7 km), to match the amount of water that flows down these falls you would need 2 million people to each pour a quart of water every second. As we //consIdered\\ what piece of music would be worthy of such incomparable locations we looked to songs that have been composed or used to praise Jesus Christ, for whom the statue was built and who billions believe created all the natural wonders of this world. We wanted to combine the melody of the heartfelt hymn of praise ""How Great Thou Art"" with one of the most beautiful melodies ever written -- the theme from the movie ""The Mission"" (""Gabriel's Oboe."") ""The Mission"" is a movie that powerfully depicts the lives of men that lay down their lives for others. It was also filmed at Iguazu Falls. ""How Great Thou Art"" praises God and all that He has done for His children on this Earth. The two harmonize so beautifully with each other, both musically and thematically. As we played these pieces in front of the Christ Statue and Iguazu Falls we felt an overwhelming sense of wonder, peace, and joy.This music video is not meant to exclude anyone that does not believe in God. We hope that it instead promotes spiritual feelings that can be felt by all -- gratitude for a beautiful Earth, for life, and for joy.A wise man once said, ""If we thought of life as a gift, we might not demand nearly as much from it. And if we lived more graciously, giving of ourselves more freely to the well-being of others, many of our personal concerns would disappear, and life would become easier for all.""We respect all beliefs and opinions, but we hope that in the comments everyone can set aside religious differences and instead focus on building each other up -- through gratitude, inspiration, kindness and mutual respect. Thank you so much for watching!

This song is the iconic moment of fighting the group that bullied you even if you‚Äôre alone against the wall. KICK is the anthem and energy needed in a world where we have to fight to be ourselves. We are faced with so many challenges and barriers in this day and age that we never thought we'd have to experience. Just when we think we‚Äôre going to be fine someone wants to put a wall in front of us. Sometimes that person can even be yourself. The goal of this song is to keep up the tenacity even when you‚Äôre scared or uncertain, to fight and kick through anything that gets in your way so you can be the best version of yourself. The song is about kicking through the bullshit, insecurities, and fear. Everything we really truly want is on the other side of fear whether it‚Äôs breaking up with someone, whether it‚Äôs asking for what we want, and being unapologetic with our true selves. Sometimes we're scared to simply be ourselves and this song is about taking back your power and telling the world ‚ÄúBring it on.

I have a B.S. in Music Technology, and got my start in the professional world as a sound designer for video games in 2007. Since, I've moved on to sound editing, music editing, and composing for multimedia. I've always had a passion for Sci-Fi and the creativity involved opens doors for composers to be as as imaginative as the material. Hopefully we can come up with something fulfilling to us all that achieves the vision that Star Citizen has.Some of my work can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/njfmusic ""Fernando Pepe:""My name is Fernando Pepe from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

I've also released four albums of various genres over the years with my most recent one being the electronic album Retr0grade.I created this group to do something that has never been done before.

Just as Soko's romantic lament takes form in the words of Saint Phalle, so does artist, curator and filmmaker Aaron Rose animate the artist's drawings from her 1971 artist book ""My Love, Where Shall We Make Love?,"" which expands and enlivens the motion implicit in Saint Phalle's accordion-folding book. The constellation of characters in ""My Love,"" including voluptuous, feminine nanas, are flattened, art brut-style illustrations of sculptural figures that Saint Phalle exhibited in museums and public parks the world over.

3397,lDnnT5l3hHk,"Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /Ààp…ëÀêli…ô/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] Fran√ßois Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille...Image By Fronteiras do Pensamento [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)], via Wikimedia Commons",Art and Music

First of all, how have 18 weeks of this year already gone by!? We thought you might like to hear a little about our process --- it is fun, frustrating, exciting, discouraging, surprising, and always enlightening!  This is an experiment for us in many things, but most importantly, the fusion of music and art.Most people don‚Äôt realize that I (Wendell) had never done any type of video editing before starting this. So for me, this involves not only learning a new medium, but figuring out how to fuse my work with the music.  For Pam, the challenge and fun is in just sitting down, without any fancy CD recording equipment or editing, to create a satisfying performance of a favorite piece . Pam says that often times, she is seeing the painting we have chosen while she plays. One constant in our collaboration is that Pam wants to see less of herself, and more of my painting, while I want to see more of her playing.  So, each week, we are trying to figure out how best to balance this!  We hope you enjoy this week‚Äôs fusion of Chopin‚Äôs beautiful Waltz in C-sharp Minor, with Wendell‚Äôs ‚ÄúGrove of Green and Gold‚Äù ‚Äìpainted in Poland last year(acrylic on paper, mounted on panel 10"" x 10"")Best wishes,Pam and Wendellwendellmyers.com / pamelahowland.com",Art and Music

I live in a tiny town in Tennessee.  I love doing fun and easy art --especially collage and mixed media journal pages-- as a way to relieve stress and give me an escape from my daily grind.  I work in a very conservative and rule driven environment.  So, these little art projects of mine have become my form of therapy.  There's little better to me than sitting down and ripping up a bunch of magazine pages, getting covered in glue, and splattering some paint and seeing where it takes me.  There's no worrying about rules, terms, judgments, or anything like that.  I just go with it and have a good time.",Art and Music

3424,PrqDFDEJMmU,The Evolution Of Hip-Hop [1979 - 2017],"Evolution Of Rap, Best Rap Song Of Each Year.Hip-hop has arguably been the best genre of music in the past two decades. As hip-hop maintains its title, a lot has changed about the genre, such as the lyrics. Hip-hop has two phases, old school and new school each of which give off a different vibe.Old School ‚ÄúHip-Hop‚Äù has music based prevalently on African American culture. Artists such as Tupac, Biggie Smalls, and Eazy-E often rap about the struggles of growing up in a racialized environment and the work they put in to get where they are today.In popular songs such as ‚ÄúChanges‚Äù by Tupac and ‚ÄúJuicy‚Äù by Biggie Smalls, the artists explain how they went from ‚Äúnegative to positive‚Äù as Biggie put it.Old school hip-hop is still popular today and is regarded as ‚Äúclassic‚Äù by many hip-hop fans.‚ÄúNew school‚Äù hip-hop has different types of lyrics. Rappers from today‚Äôs generation sing typically about girls, money, and cars they have. Some even sing about how they do drgs, drink alchl, and party which sets a bad example for some listeners. Some of these rappers today did not have it as hard as rappers back in the old days. Also Hip-hop artists now are racially diverse, so African American culture is not necessarily found in music today.People who grew up listening to Tupac, Biggie, Eazy-E, and so on typically do not enjoy hip-hop in today‚Äôs era. Songs written when rap was introduced were lyrically better because rappers were able to tell a story using words that rhyme and flow.Some songs are also more appealing to fans because they can relate to the struggles their favorite rappers faced.People of this generation are used to listening to new school hip-hop which is the most played genre on the radio. These same fans reject old school Hip-Hop as a part of the music genre. There are even rappers who know nothing about the most influential Hip-Hop artists.Growing up listening to Eminem has caused me to fall in love with him as an artist. He introduced me to Hip-Hop. But I noticed a change in the music industry. Artists wanted to be part of the mainstream industry and they had to change their music to fit into the mainstream category.Because of new artists in hip-hop, many lessen known artists are rarely noticed. These artists are said to be ‚Äúunderground.‚Äù Underground rappers usually do not make it big because they have music related to the messages embodied by old school hip-hop artists would say.Some people think old school Hip-Hop is better than new school Hip-Hop. And there are many people who prefer underground Hip-Hop to mainstream Hip-Hop.

Just as Soko's romantic lament takes form in the words of Saint Phalle, so does artist, curator and filmmaker Aaron Rose animate the artist's drawings from her 1971 artist book ""My Love, Where Shall We Make Love?,"" which expands and enlivens the motion implicit in Saint Phalle's accordion-folding book. The constellation of characters in ""My Love,"" including voluptuous, feminine nanas, are flattened, art brut-style illustrations of sculptural figures that Saint Phalle exhibited in museums and public parks the world over.

Hopefully we can come up with something fulfilling to us all that achieves the vision that Star Citizen has.Some of my work can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/njfmusic ""Fernando Pepe:""My name is Fernando Pepe from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I'm 22 and I started to composing last year but I play guitar/piano since 12 years old.I work with game development (indie game) on soundtracks, sound design, etc.. I took responsibility for it and I'm improving my knowledge since I really like the matter.Find more about my work here: https://soundcloud.com/ferpepeCaden L Welborn:I'm a twenty one year old musician, composer, and orchestrator. I've been playing the piano since I was two and creating music since I was four. Over the years I've made music of all different genres of music, from piano, electronic, orchestral, to everything in between. I've also released four albums of various genres over the years with my most recent one being the electronic album Retr0grade.I created this group to do something that has never been done before. The creation of a professional quality unofficial/fan made soundtrack for a game that is still being worked on. I believe we soundly accomplished this goal.You can go to my site here: http://cadenlwelborn.comYou can find my works here: https://soundcloud.com/caden-l-welbornAnd here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheCadenL...Yuchen Tian:""My name is Yuchen Tian. I currently live in Richmond, Virginia. I have been playing guitar since 14, with genres ranging from indie rock to metal. I make electronic dance music such as trance and eurodance. I also from time to time write other kinds of music as you can hear on my SoundCloud page. I don't have any formal musical education, but I have a great feeling for music, and that helps greatly on writing music.I've always been a lover of space and space sims. Star Citizen is a long awaited dream.

The recording of We Are The World 25 For Haiti embodied the same enthusiasm, sense of purpose and generosity as the original recording 25 years ago. Every one of the artists who participated, regardless of genre or generation, walked into the room with their hearts and souls completely open to coming together to help the people of Haiti.",Art and Music

3455,Ys4zR5fKFp0,Christafari - How Great Thou Art (Official Music Video) feat. Solomon Jabby (Part 2),"Become a musicianary partner today: http://www.christafari.com/donate Help us bring the JOY and salvation of Christ to the hurting and lost throughout the world. WHAT WERE WE THINKING WHEN WE MADE THIS VIDEO?(About the video)We had an absolute blast filming this video. It‚Äôs by far the craziest short that I‚Äôve ever produced. While some may see it as one part Willy Wonka and one part Sgt. Pepper with a little Lee Scratch Perry and George Clinton thrown in for good measure, we were actually inspired by something totally different.  There is a guy who lives in a large van on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach not too far from our house. For years he‚Äôs been called a ‚ÄúJesus freak.‚Äù And not in a good way.  No church will accept him. His car is covered in colorful crosses and large neon letters that read ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù and ‚ÄúHoly.‚Äù Every day he is a billboard for Christ as he paces the sidewalks wearing his captain‚Äôs hat and long flowing coat (regardless of the weather). He unsuccessfully tries to stop every single passerby, asking if he can read a Bible verse to them and pray for them. Most evade him or downright ignore him. While his methods might not appear to be the most effective, I believe his heart is in the right place and his goals are pure.  To some he‚Äôs an embarrassment, but in a weird way, I‚Äôm inspired by him.What if we were all this passionate and bold for Jesus? Let‚Äôs face it, when we first start following Christ we are on fire ‚Äî so passionate about the Lord. But eventually our colorful flower of faith began to fade into what often becomes mundane and muted from its original form. But what if we kept this passion? What if we continued to fan the flame and never lost our zeal? What if we still shared our faith with the fervor we had when we were just saved? This is how I want to be. Though I may not paint neon crosses and ‚ÄúJesus Saves‚Äù across my minivan, I will try and keep them on my mind and ever-present in my conversations. While some may see this video as a psychedelic trip-out and wonder what we were on when we filmed it (nothing, of course), that is the furthest thing from our desire or initial intention while making it. This video was created to show the mind-blowing contrast between being lost and being found. The difference between being all alone, surrounded by death and destruction, and then being surrounded by the fellowship of others in the light of Christ. We‚Äôre showing the journey from the slow monotonous drudgery of existence to an exciting and empowered life bursting with energy!It‚Äôs about going from muted colors in an almost sepia-toned world to living a vibrant and Technicolor faith!Over all, it‚Äôs an allegory for salvation. For when you‚Äôve found Christ, you will truly realize that all of those clich√©s that you‚Äôve heard sung for years are so true: ‚ÄúI once was lost but now am found; was blind but now I see!‚ÄùLive your faith with zeal. Be bold, passionate and, yes, WILD for Christ. Don‚Äôt let the world tame your faith or mute your colors. Find that inner Jesus freak that you once were when you first found Christ and cry out to your loving Savior ‚ÄúRestore unto me the JOY of my salvation!‚Äù===============================MORE INFO:This is the Official Music Video for Christafari's ska version of ""How Great Thou Art"" featuring Solomon Jabby from Christafari's ""Anthems"" CD.

He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith began to fight about sex position. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air. Adam stood in prayer before his Creator: 'Sovereign of the universe!' he said, 'the woman you gave me has run away.' At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels to bring her back and blah blah blah... later they call her demon etc since she didn't wanna follow Adam and God rules.In this story, I realize men have always long been misogyny and try to destroy women reputation who choose not listen and follow their rules, this includes shaming Eve to eat the fruit from the Tree of knowledge of good and evil. And I am going to fight this misogyny by naming this channel [House of Lilith].  House of Lilith, for those who not afraid to speak up, seek equality, fairness in life and fight back.- - - * I would like to pay respect to Elders past and present. I recognize and respect their cultural heritage, beliefs, and relationship with the land, which continue to be important to the Aboriginal people living today.",Art and Music

3502,fZaqyfGuRr8,Sui Dhaaga: Made in India,"""Sui Dhaaga - Made in India"" is a heart-warming story of pride and self-reliance, which finds its roots in the heart of India and reflects the passion that runs through the veins of every single Indian. Taking the message of ""Made in India"" forward, the film modestly tries to bring back our traditional art forms and handicrafts in focus. Through Mauji (Varun Dhawan) & his wife Mamta (Anushka Sharma), the film talks about the need of social entrepreneurship as a tool for social and economic development of our artisans, living their life in the margins due to the changing times. Set in a small town in India, the film encapsulates the journey of an honest man from a humble background, who pursues his passion, overcoming all odds and soon finds himself on the cover of an international magazine with the world taking note and appreciating his talent. A clean family entertainer, the film emphasizes virtues like honesty, self-respect and community living.",Art and Music
